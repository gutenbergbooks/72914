<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Alone on this strange little world in the orbit of Saturn, the man who knew himself as
Nemo, and the golden haired girl who called herself Nona, lived the lives of simple
primitives. But weird was this planetoid where rocks burned and the water was fit to
breathe, yet no less fantastic than the meteor itself was the bizarre Marinoid people
who dwelt deep in its waters! A tale to remember.</span></p>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1>CHAPTER I</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know where I was born.
I am ignorant of the country—I do
not even know on which world it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall tell you my history exactly as I
remember it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first recollection that I have was
when I was a young man at the full height
of my physical strength. Let us say, I was
twenty, with dark hair and eyes, a slender
body, but muscular and powerful. The day
I have in mind is clear to my memory now—but
everything that happened to me before
it is a blank. I found myself lying
on the ground. It was dark and there was
a sky full of stars and strange flashing lights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat up, stiff and sore, and bruised all
over. I was encased in some sort of a rubber
suit, with a pack on my back; my head
was enclosed in a helmet of transparent,
rigid material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt as though I were smothering; and
I tore off the helmet and flung it from me.
I drank in a deep breath of the night air.
It was pure and sweet, but heady. It made
my senses reel like some potent wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I say that I sat up. That is not strictly
true. I pushed my elbow against the ground,
and my whole body went into the air. I
floated back to a sitting posture. I was
light as a feather!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was calm without a breath of
air stirring—— Lucky for me for I would
have blown away had there been any wind!
I sat there puzzling over my very existence.
I knew nothing, not even my own name.
I have since named myself Nemo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This place where I found myself that
starry night showed a barren landscape with
only a few queerly-shaped, stunted trees.
The horizon was very close to me—almost
at hand, in fact—for the ground was curved
with an enormous convexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, indeed, as though I were clinging
to the top of a ball, whirling through Space.
The stars were swinging across the sky with
visible movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been conscious no more than a minute
when a moon swung into view. Then
another. And then, without warning, a million
tiny worlds flashing silver with reflected
sunlight, burst up from below the
horizon and swarmed the heavens. Behind
them I saw a tremendous, glowing silver
sphere, with dark bands upon it—a sphere
so large that as it rose it almost filled the
sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was on a tiny meteor—one of the myriad
that swarm in circular orbits about the planet
Saturn and form its rings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saturn, in position outward from the Sun,
is the sixth major planet of the Solar System.
Its mean distance from the Sun is
887,098,000 miles. It is a globe almost as
large as Jupiter—74,163 miles in diameter,
to be exact. It has, however, a trifle less
than half Jupiter’s density and only one-ninth
the density of the Earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Saturn’s rings you are perhaps familiar
in a general way. They are concentric,
and encircle the planet like a flat hat-brim—a
brim more than 37,000 miles broad.
These rings are composed of billions upon
billions of tiny meteors revolving about Saturn
all in almost the same plane and each
maintaining its separate orbit—each a tiny
satellite, each glowing silver from its reflected
sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was upon one of these tiny meteors
that I found myself. Do not imagine
that I knew all these facts at the moment.
Far from it. I had no knowledge of any
kind. My body was developed to manhood
but I was ignorant of everything with only
instinct and a dawning reason to guide me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had tossed away my transparent helmet.
It left my hand and went through the air
like a stone from a catapult. The last I
saw of it it was sailing out over a line of
trees. My brain was still confused but I
knew that my body was over-warm. I took
off the rubber garment and pack, finding
myself in a white knitted affair like a bathing
suit—sleeveless shirt and trunks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stood up unsteadily, and found that I
had just enough weight to maintain my
footing. My head was reeling, I suppose,
largely because of the quality of the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Air, you say! Air on a meteor like that!
Do you call yourself an astronomer? If so,
you show your ignorance by such questioning.
Air, or at least something that served
my purposes of breathing, was there and
that I am here alive to tell it must be your
proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could see perhaps a quarter of a mile.
The land curved away, dropping down in
every direction so that the sky at the horizon
showed seemingly below the level of my
feet. I was visibly on the top of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overhead those billions of tiny worlds
were swarming. Sometimes fragments of
star-dust would enter my atmosphere—flaming
red shooting stars, burning themselves
out in an instant. And behind everything
hung that gigantic silver ball that was Saturn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole firmament was swinging sidewise.
In a few moments half of Saturn
was below my horizon. The Sun rose behind
me—a smaller Sun than appears to you
here on Earth, but still the same yellow-red
color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was daylight, with the Sun mounting
toward the zenith so quickly in less than an
hour it would be there, and my day would
be half over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw myself now to be standing on a
slight rise of black, sandy ground. There
were metallic rocks lying about, a low,
scanty vegetation in patches on the ground—vegetation
of a bluish color; and flimsy,
stunted trees. These had broad, angular
blue-white trunks with spreading tops ten
feet up, and foliage that was bluish-white.
Behind me was a jagged, metallic peak perhaps
a hundred feet in height.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no water in sight, no sign of
life of any kind. Quite suddenly I discovered
that I was both hungry and thirsty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was I to do? This world was so
small I could have started walking in any
direction and come back to my starting point
in a very short time. Walking! It was impossible
to walk! I weighed almost nothing.
I stood teetering on tip-toe, straining every
muscle to maintain my balance, feeling like
a balloon poised ready to sail away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took a step forward. Under the impulse
of my gentle leg-thrust, my body rose into
the air in a broad arc. I suppose I went up
a hundred feet, sailing forward toward the
line of trees at the horizon. I lost my balance;
my arms and legs were flying. I
floated gently down and landed on my face
near the base of a tree!</p>

<p class='pindent'>You smile! I assure you it was not humorous
to me. I stood up again, trembling
with surprise and alarm. A new vista of
land beyond the former horizon had opened.
I saw other little jagged peaks a few hundred
feet away and behind them, over that
dizzying curve downward of the world, was
the azure of cloudless Space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was frightened, and now I know it was
with good reason. Had I leaped recklessly
into the air I might have left my tiny world
entirely—escaped from its slight gravitation
sufficiently to become its satellite, or
perhaps even completely to depart its vicinity
and become a satellite of Saturn!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This tiny world upon which I found myself
was inhospitable to the extreme; and yet
if I had been conscious of the choice, I
would not have wanted to abandon it for
empty Space. Out there, worse than suffering
hunger and thirst, I would not be able
to breathe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever my life before this day may
have been, walking evidently was part of it.
I know that because my instinct was to walk.
I decided to weigh myself down with rocks
and thus be able to maintain a footing.
Futile conception! I seized a huge rock
of black metallic quartz in each hand—only
to find that the rocks themselves were mere
feathers in my grasp! Angered, I flung
them into the air. They sailed away, out over
the horizon. Undoubtedly they left my world
never to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sun was now past the zenith. It was
mid-afternoon. Shortly it would be night
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was clinging to the tree-trunk for support,
when quite near me I saw what seemed
to be the mouth of a cave. I was staring
at it when a figure appeared from below.
I did not move, and this thing evidently
did not see me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a girl, fashioned in human form
like myself. She stood there cloaked in the
long waving masses of her hair. I must
have made some slight sound for after a
moment she looked my way. I caught a
glimpse of a beautiful oval face framed in
the golden tresses, lips full and red, eyes
blue, wide now with fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without warning, she left the ground.
She went swiftly past me, lying in the air
gracefully on one side, her arms moving
rhythmically. She was swimming in the
air with all the grace and skill of a mermaid!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stood spellbound. In a moment she had
passed over the curve of the world and
disappeared.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Can I say that the sight of this girl
inspired in me any emotion stronger
than my passions of hunger and
thirst? Not so. I was in the full bloom
of my manhood, yet the sight of this beautiful
woman thrilled me because now I knew
instinctively I might find food and water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I scrambled forward, holding myself to
the ground with difficulty, and entered the
mouth of her cave like some marauding animal
seeking the sustenance I craved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cave-mouth gave into a tunnel leading
at an angle downward. The walls were
smooth. I forced myself down, half sliding,
half gently falling. For an instant
the thought came to me that I would encounter
other living creatures—things to
keep me from the food and drink I wanted.
Had I met them—humans or beasts—I know
I should have fought desperately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dark in the tunnel; but soon I saw
that the rocks were glowing with a phosphorescence.
This grew brighter as I advanced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went down perhaps two hundred feet;
then the tunnel opened. I was in a subterranean
chamber of indeterminate size, possibly
five hundred feet square, with a black
rocky ceiling some fifty feet above me. The
whole place was dimly lighted by the red-silver
glow which came from the rocks.
The air was denser, with a pungent, aromatic
odor. It seemed to strengthen me and clear
my head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sides of the cave were rough and
broken with overhanging rocks like shelves.
Here and there were other small tunnel-mouths.
Most important of all, a small subterranean
stream crossed the cave, opening
up into a little lagoon near the center. It
was a thin-looking, milk-white fluid. I
flung myself down to it with a splash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It tasted, not like milk, but like pure, cold
water, though very thin and light. I drank
my fill. The joy of it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pile of blue fabric—woven
grass—on the bank beside the stream. The
girl’s couch, it proved to be. The robes
were very soft, gossamer in weight. I started
to dry myself upon one of them. But
the water—I shall call it that—evaporated
like alcohol, and I was dry in a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was food here. A patch of black
soil had queer, fungus-like growths in it.
I had no doubt it was the girl’s food. There
were the remains of a fire, though I did not
know what it was at the time. On a stone
was some of the fungus which had been
cooked. Of this I ate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the couch I lay at ease. The blue
robes lay around me like swan’s down. My
slight weight made me seem floating in
them. It was my first conscious moment of
physical peace.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>With hunger and thirst appeased my
thoughts turned to the girl. She was
not only the first woman, but, to my memory,
the first living thing I had ever seen.
Where was she now? Could I capture her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the cave I saw something move.
The mouth of a passageway was there beyond
the stream; and in the dim glow of
light I could make out the girl standing
there. She was watching me as I lay in possession
of her couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I held myself motionless. After a moment
she began coming forward, timidly,
yet curiously to inspect me. She stopped at
the edge of the stream no more than fifty
feet away. Her hair fell in waves to her
knees. She stood hesitating, frightened, yet
drawn by a power greater than her fear. I
could see the muscles of her limbs tensed
for instant flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had intended to leap suddenly across
the stream but a strange shyness came over
me. Instead, I called to her. Words? I
had no spoken language. I called some
syllable. It startled her; but she answered—a
soft little call of shy friendliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wanted her to come to my side of the
stream, but she would not. I beckoned to
her; but she moved backward on fairy-like
tip-toed steps. It angered me. I waved
my arm vehemently and tried to climb to
my feet, struggling with the airy, half-floating
robes of the couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl took flight. Her arms struck
out, and like a swimmer mounting through
water she floated up to the ceiling, landing
upon a ledge of rock. Through a tangle
of her hair her face peered down at me.
And though her eyes were frightened, there
seemed an impish, mocking expression to her
tremulous smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shyness dropped from me. She would
obey me; I would make her. I kicked myself
into the air and swam as I had seen her
swim. But it was not as easy as it looked.
I turned over in the air, losing my balance
in spite of myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I reached the ledge, striking my shoulder
violently upon it as I landed in a heap.
But she was not there. Across the cave,
down by the couch she stood poised on tip-toe,
looking at me. And this time her red
mouth and dancing eyes were openly mocking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For half an hour I pursued her about the
cave; but she eluded me as easily as though
she had been a butterfly and I one of your
Earth-children in eager chase. She could
have escaped from the cave, but she had no
fear of me now. At last, bruised and exhausted
by my futile efforts, I sank upon
her couch; and again she stood nearby, regarding
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was angry and sulky. I pretended to
disregard her. At last, utterly worn out, I
fell asleep.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When I awoke, the girl was sitting
beside me. Her soft fingers
had been stroking my hair; it
was their touch which awakened me. As I
moved and opened my eyes, she instantly
withdrew beyond my reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was hungry and when I motioned to
her and indicated the food, she seemed to
understand. I sat quite still, and within a
few minutes she was deftly preparing a
meal. But I was aware that she watched
me narrowly and seldom came within my
reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire she produced by rubbing two
stones together. It seemed to ignite the
stones, with a tiny flickering flame like the
burning of sulphur. She had gathered a
pile of dried vegetation from the surface
above the cave; and when that was blazing
she added rocks that glowed like coal. The
fire interested me tremendously. It alarmed
me; but only at first, for I saw that the girl
had no fear of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I need not go into details. Her manner
was proud when presently she indicated the
hot food ready to eat and she watched me
expectantly while I tasted it. I smiled my
approval and beckoned her to take some of
it with me. At which she curled up on the
robe beside me, eating the food I pushed
toward her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were friends. Like myself, she had
no spoken language. But when we tried to
talk it came fast. I indicated myself and
told her I was Nemo. The word seemed
to spring readily to my mind; I have no
doubt it was some part of my earlier life.
She had no name. I called her Nona. It
seemed to please her. She repeated it after
me half a dozen times, and clapped her
hands delightedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later we went up to the surface
of our tiny world. It chanced to be daylight;
and Nona taught me how to swim
through the air, how to handle myself
against this lack of gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The art came to me quickly. I was soon
able to swim about with swift, powerful
strokes. My stronger muscles gave me an
advantage over her. I could swim more
quickly; but I could never attain her deftness,
her agility. She would swoop about,
dive head downward in a graceful arc, right
herself and land on tip-toe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We circled our little globe, swimming at
an altitude of a hundred feet, and following
the Sun; and within half an hour were
back at our starting point. Everywhere I
saw the same bleak landscape. It was night
when we returned, for we had overtaken
the Sun and passed it. But in a few moments
daylight came again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Nona showed me how to jump.
With arms folded, she leaped vertically into
the air. Straight up her body shot, her hair
brushed flat against her by the downward
rush of wind. She held herself upright by
throwing out a hand occasionally. Like an
arrow she mounted; until standing on the
ground I could see her only as a tiny dark
speck against the blue of the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came swimming down a few moments
later, her hair waving like a cloak behind
her, spun gold with the sunlight on it. She
was laughing and flushed from the exertion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then at arm’s length with fingers clasped,
we leaped upward together. The tiny world
dropped away. Looking down, it showed
itself as a ball. I could see far around it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We seemed to mount endlessly. The air
grew so rare I gasped for breath. My head
was roaring. I was cold. Below, I could
see the spherical meteor turning under us.
We were in Space, no longer a part of our
world. And we had almost reached the
limit of its atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona’s fingers clutched mine tightly.
Suddenly she twisted me downward and
dropped me. A strong side wind had sprung
up. We swam down against it, fighting our
way until we at last were back to the meteor’s
surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was tired, for through my clumsiness I
had used far more energy than Nona; but
I would not let her see it. I saw her look
upon the muscles of my arms and shoulders,
and her admiration pleased me. I stretched
my arms for her, showed her the muscles of
my legs; and looked about for some way
of displaying my prowess. There were many
boulders around that could be loosened. One
by one I flung them into the air, sent them
into Space never to return.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Nona watched me with awe, encouraging
me with little syllables of
pleasure as I selected larger and larger
rocks. Some I dug up and tore loose, until
at last I ripped off the top and side of a
hill. It was a mountain of rock. I staggered
like Atlas, with it over my head, and
then launched it into the air. It rose a
short distance, and fell back to form another
hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona gazed at me with new respect and
with a look in her eyes that made my heart
pound. I was casting about for some larger
burden, but she drew me away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was pleased. A sense of my own power
filled me. I was master here on this world
of mine. I could have taken it apart bit
by bit and tossed it into Space. I could
tear down mountains, build others in their
stead.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='caption'>“<span class='it'>With my slight weight, I could lift huge masses of stone.</span>”</p>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Facts and figures? I am in a position
now to give them to you. My meteor had
a diameter of five miles, a circumference of
some fifteen. Its density relative to Earth
was .67. Its surface gravity—again relative
to your Earth—was .00039, placing Earth
as 1.00. My weight at the surface of my
meteor—neglecting other factors which I
shall name in a moment—was slightly over
one ounce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without undue exertion I could leap upward
nearly ten thousand feet—that is to
say, almost two miles. And the mountain
of rock I tossed into the air on your Earth
would have weighed some 320,000 pounds!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said that the boulders I tossed upward
left the surface of the meteor never to
return. At an initial velocity of 13 feet a
second, all objects became satellites of the
meteor, revolving about it comparatively
close to the surface in perfect circles. The
velocity of escape was but 18½ feet a second,
i. e., that velocity which would cause
an object to pass into outer Space, moving
onward until it found some larger body to
encircle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I give these figures without corrections
for atmosphere, axial rotation of the
meteor, or the attraction of other bodies.
Theoretically they are accurate, though in
practice they were altered somewhat. During
our brief days we weighed more than
I have stated; while at night, less. Indeed,
had we essayed a jump into the air at night,
we should doubtless have been unable to
struggle our way back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How can that be, you ask? Our proximity
to Saturn! Around this great planet
we were revolving at a distance of no more
than thirty-five thousand miles. Saturn’s
surface gravity is a trifle greater than that
of your earth—1.07 to be exact. Saturn’s
density is only one-ninth that of the Earth;
but the difference is made up because of its
tremendous size. Saturn’s gravity—to us
on the meteor—was an appreciable pull,
even though diminished by the distance between
us, and further offset by the meteor’s
rapid rotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, you see, when Saturn was below
us—in daytime—its gravity was added to
ours. But at night, when it was in the
sky above, it was subtracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These conditions applied to the days I
am describing. Our meteor was then between
Saturn and the Sun. Later in our
year, when we had passed around Saturn,
the Sun was blotted out. There was then no
daylight—merely alternate periods of a sky
filled with Saturn’s silver disk and the
azure, star-filled outer Space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have not mentioned the time of our
meteor’s axial rotation. It was, as you on
Earth measure time, 2 hours, 58 minutes. A
complete day and night in less than three
hours!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I had finished showing Nona my
strength, it was night again. And such a
night! Saturn no more than thirty-five
thousand miles away! The darkened bands
were plainly visible. When fully overhead,
the circular limb of the planet came down
in all directions almost to our horizon. The
silver light from it was dazzling. And everywhere
in the sky, meteors like ourselves
were whirling past—silver in Space, flaming
red when fragments of them struck our
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally a meteorite would strike our
surface, but we had no fear of them. For
an hour perhaps, we stood together, silent,
gazing with awe at these mysteries of the
sky. Until at last Nona gently drew me
back to her cave.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Within the cave the air seemed
warmer than before, perhaps because
I was flushed and tired
from my exertion. The radiant light from
the rocks was soft. Here all was quiet and
peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once I threw myself upon Nona’s
couch, stretching my limbs, head pillowed
upon my crooked arm. For a time, as before
she stood regarding me. There was
in her gaze now no fear, but a curious softness.
I sensed it. With sudden thought
she smiled, and swam across the cave. She
got a stone, hollowed out like a cup. She
filled it at the stream and offered it to me.
I drank gratefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again I was conscious of hunger. The
fungus-like food was unsatisfying. I made
Nona understand, and she seemed distressed.
I could see she wanted to feed me
but had no other food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally she motioned me to lie quiet. I
watched her as she stretched herself prone
on the ground near me. Her head was
raised; she was looking keenly, carefully
about the cave. Then she began swimming,
slowly, stealthily, no more than a foot
or two above the cave floor, circling about,
up along the walls, back overhead following
the line of the ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once, when she was hovering over by the
side wall, I saw her grow suddenly alert. I
followed her steady gaze; and on a rock
fifty feet from her I made out the outlines
of something lying motionless. It looked
like a lizard some three feet long, with
white eyes standing out from its forehead.
It was because of the eyes that I first saw it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona was in midair. Then, like a wasp
she darted at that thing on the rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lizard—I shall call it that—saw her
coming. It leaped, and sailed across the
cave. I saw it that it had webbed membranes
connecting its six outstretched legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona turned in the air after it, her slim
body as sinuous as her waving hair itself.
She was faster than the lizard, but again, on
the opposite side of the cave, it eluded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back and forth across the cave they went.
Often the reptile would dash for one of the
passageways but Nona with her greater intelligence,
always anticipated it and was
there to bar its way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lizard seemed jointed all over, and
it could turn in the air with extraordinary
swiftness. But not so swift as Nona. Once
the reptile whirled back and forth on a sustained
flight. Nona followed its every
twist and turn as one bird follows another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last she had it in her arms, in midair
at the center of the cave. Calling to me in
triumph, she struggled with it, fighting her
way down to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I started toward her, but her voice and
gesture waved me away. The lizard was
screaming—a shrill, hideous scream. But
she had its back bent across her knee. Its
spine broke with a crack. It lay still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By one foreleg she held its quivering
body up to me; she was laughing with happiness
as she sought my applause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ate the meat of its tail and legs; and
satiated, I lay somnolent on the robes and
watched Nona moving about the cave. She
extinguished the fire, and at last approached
me timidly. I did not notice her. My eyes
were half closed. I was vaguely planning
my own hunting for food—wondering if
there would be other reptiles larger, for me
to capture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A twitch at the coverings on which I was
lying aroused me. Nona was pulling a robe
out from under me for herself. I pushed it
toward her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not move. It was very soundless in
the cave with only the murmuring of the
stream. Nona curled up on her robe near
me. Thus we lay silent; but I felt her shy
gaze always upon me and suddenly I came
back to complete wakefulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stared wordlessly at each other until
her gaze timidly dropped. With heart
racing, I moved myself slowly toward her.
I was afraid to frighten her; but she moved,
not away, but to me. Abruptly my arms
were around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus I found my habitable world and my
mate—beyond which the legitimate needs of
man do not go.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The days that followed were happy ones
for us both. We lived in our cave and
seldom left it. The securing of food, preparing
it, eating it, and sleeping until we were
hungry again—this was our life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Animals, yet both of us with the latent
intelligence of civilized human beings! Our
spoken language came very fast. We seemed
to be pent up with words, which once
spoken were remembered almost without
conscious effort. So it is with your Earth-children
who are the despair of their parents
because sometimes they do not talk until
they are almost two years old. They have
it stored up—and when they do give voice,
their fluency is amazing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our language? I cannot tell you what it
was; I do not know. It seemed almost as
though we were inventing it as we went
along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona, in her spiritual and mental
existence, was the counterpart of myself.
Who she was, where she had come from—those
questions she could not answer. Her
mental life had started on the meteor with
herself almost a matured woman. One’s
mental life, you will realize, is dependent
exclusively upon memory. And Nona’s
memory previous to the time of our meeting
was short and dim. Perhaps human memory
only exists with spoken language—or
social intercourse of a similar kind. I do
not know. Even your hermit speaks, or
has spoken to his fellow man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed. How much time I cannot
say. A month—five months perhaps. Time
is as inconstant as the wind itself, as you
would very soon perceive were you to live
in semi-darkness, eating when you could get
the food, sleeping when you were tired—and
with no mechanical timepiece or its
equivalent to measure arbitrarily your passing
existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The securing of a steady and varied supply
of food gave us trouble. The day came
when we could not capture a lizard. The
fungus-like stuff Nona was growing I had
begun heartily to dislike. I had searched
every corner of the cave and its passageways
for a lizard and had come back unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona had started a fire and was sitting
beside it drying her hair. Water was evaporating
from her shoulders; she had been
in the stream. A few molluscs, or something
of the kind, lay at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See!” she cried triumphantly. “They
are to eat. My man Nemo can get them—they
are in the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I broke them open and ate one. It was
good. I kissed her approvingly and her
arms clung about my neck. Nona always
was happiest in my approbation; she seemed
to think of nothing save how to win it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When her caresses were passed, I stood
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do I get them?” I demanded.
“Nona must show me once—then I will
get very many of them for us to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona led me to the stream and we waded
into it waist-deep. I had bathed here, but
I had never been further along. Nona had,
however. She led me forward to where the
water went under a low archway of our
cave and thence into the bowels of the
meteor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river-bed under my feet began sloping
downward. The water deepened around
me—to my chest, shoulders, almost to my
neck. I was terrified. I pulled back from
Nona’s hand which was drawing me along.
Her hair was floating out like golden seaweed
around us. The milk-white water was
under her uptilted chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes smiled at me tenderly. “No,”
she said. “My man Nemo never can he be
afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afraid! I could not let her see that. I
grunted scornfully, and we went forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water rose to my own chin. We were
well underground now—the ceiling of this
subterranean passageway was hardly a foot
above my head. In front of me I could see
where the ceiling touched the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly I remembered Nona. One of
her hands still held mine—the other was
braced against a projection of the side wall
to hold us against the gentle current that
pressed us forward. The water now almost
reached the top of her head. I could see her
face beneath the surface. Her mouth was
opened round and wide; a stream of air
bubbles came gurgling up from it. Her
chest was expanding and contracting rhythmically
and swiftly, seemingly with great
effort, like a man panting after an exhausting
run. <span class='it'>She was breathing the water!</span></p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I stared at Nona silently. The air
bubbles from her mouth grew less,
until soon there were almost none of
them. The tidal air in her lungs had been
forced out; water had taken its place.
Through her opened mouth she was drawing
in the water and expelling it—rapid
respirations taxing the intercostal muscles
almost to their limit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona smiled up at me through the
water, which in spite of its milk-white color,
was curiously limpid and transparent. I felt
the tug of her hand; I stepped forward,
and in the deepening water my face went
under.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever may have been my previous
existence, an experience such as this quite
evidently was no part of it. My instinct was
to hold my breath. I did so until I could
no longer. I struggled against Nona’s hand
and tried to get my head above the surface.
But she held me; and my fear of having
her know me to be afraid was greater than
my fear of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last I let out my pent-up breath. It
gurgled from my mouth in bubbles. Then,
in a gulp of desperation, I inhaled. The
water choked me. I tried to cough; but
could not—or at least the cough became
my exhalation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My ears were roaring as though the torrents
of your Niagara were rushing past
them. My head and chest seemed bursting—icy-cold
at first, then burning with fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My eyes were open. I was standing beside
Nona and she was looking up at me.
Through the half-light of the water I could
see her almost as plainly as through air.
She smiled encouragingly at me, and I tried
to smile back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was drawing the water in and out swiftly
now, with my mouth held extended like
an expiring fish. It was a tremendous effort,
this respiration. The muscles of my chest
and diaphragm were tired in a moment. A
weight in my chest seemed smothering my
heart; I seemed on fire inside—a million
inflamed little lung passages rebelling at
this unaccustomed medium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spots were dancing before my eyes. I
was losing consciousness through lack of
oxygen. The poisoned venous blood was
dulling my brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I began to feel better. I was respiring
now almost as swiftly as Nona, and
with far less effort than I had used at first.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>You are skeptical? Because <span class='it'>you</span> cannot
breathe your Earth-water, you assume
that <span class='it'>I</span> could not breathe this water on my
meteor. What quaint logic that is! Yet I
find all you Earth-people think on similar
lines. It is your inadequate mentality, I
suppose, so I must hasten to enlighten you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two fundamental objects of
respiration. First: the introduction into the
system of oxygen by which the products
resulting from the disintegration of the muscular,
nervous and other tissues of the body
may be converted into compounds easily
eliminated. Secondly: the direct removal of
the most noxious and therefore most important
of these waste products—carbonic acid
gas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In man, as you know him on Earth, this
is accomplished by the lungs. The venous
blood, charged with its carbonic acid and
its waste products, needing a renewal of
oxygen and a removal of the carbonic acid,
is pumped by the heart through the lungs.
These by their construction present an immense
amount of internal surface covered
by a vascular network, through which the
blood flows in innumerable minute streamlets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In respiration, the inhaled air is separated
from the blood only by an extraordinarily
thin membrane—less than 1/20,000 of an
inch in thickness. Through this membrane
the blood absorbs oxygen from the air, giving
in return to the air its noxious carbonic
acid gas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is the basic process in you Earth-men.
In the case, let us say, of your Earth-fishes
breathing your water, there is little
fundamental difference. The blood in their
gills is brought practically into contact with
a steadily moving stream of water. But
fishes do not get their oxygen from the
water in some mysterious fashion. Did you
think they did? They get the oxygen, not
from water, but from air—the air that is
held in solution in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for two things, you on Earth could
breathe your water. First, your lung passages
are too minute to receive a substance
so heavy, so <span class='it'>unvolatile</span>, let me say, as is the
water of Earth. Secondly, there is not proportionally
enough air in your water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both these conditions were different on
my meteor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This water on my meteor was very different
from water as you know it. I have
already said it was light and thin. To be
exact, I estimate that on your Earth it would
have a specific gravity of no more than .18,
placing your water at 1.00.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In your sea-water a normally fleshy man
will float with a small margin to spare.
This water on my meteor was not saline;
but more than that, Nona and I stood submerged
in it with hardly any perceptible
feeling of buoyancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me make my point still clearer. The
low specific gravity of this water compared
to yours was principally caused by the large
amount of air it held in solution. It was, in
a word, highly aerified to an extent proportionally
eleven times more than is your
average water on Earth. For this reason,
my lungs needed but one-eleventh the
amount of it from which to secure the
necessary oxygen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Earth, your normal respiration varies
widely; sixteen to twenty times per minute
for a healthy adult at rest might be taken
as a fair average. I was breathing this water
at approximately eighty respirations per
minute.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know how long I stood there
under the surface with Nona before I
attained semblance of normality. But gradually
the burning in my chest and the smothering
of my heart subsided. My brain
cleared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked about me curiously. The water
was clear and transparent to a remarkable
degree. There seemed inherent light diffused
through it, like a phosphorescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had taken several steps forward and
were well below the surface now. Underneath
my feet was a sandy soil. To the
right and left were rocky walls—the sides
of the submerged tunnel. And ahead lay
open water, dim in the distance, with the
narrow sandy floor sloping downward like
a path down a hillside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything was slightly blurred in outline.
Nona’s hair floated out and above her. The
freedom of movement we had had in the
air above was gone. We were hampered in
moving by the friction of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was nothing like the friction of
walking in your water. Indeed, it was far
more like your Earthly existence on land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am very specific in detailing these sensations.
You will see why in a moment; you
will see that this experience was the means
of saving both our lives—Nona’s and mine—and
projecting us into a new era of my
existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For after the very next time of sleep, the
catastrophe to our tiny world overtook us.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We found our molluscs and
struggled back up the sloping
path to shallow water. On the
bank I lay and coughed, gasping and struggling
to remove the residual water from
my lungs and replace it with air. The transition
back was far worse than entering the
water. Nona, who quite evidently had done
it several times before, recovered more
quickly than I. As I lay panting and choking
upon our couch, she made up a fire.
The two stones which she rubbed together
ignited in a moment—a slow, sulphurous-looking
flame with a little smoke which the
slight current of air through the cave carried
away. Then, when the first stones were
burning, she added other stones which
glowed like coal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ate our meal, and I lay again upon
our couch with Nona sitting beside me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was awakened by a sense of burning
and smothering. I sat up, coughed, and
twitched at Nona’s hair to arouse her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cave was full of smoke. Beside me
was what seemed a pit of fire. The heat
from it was intolerable. I flung Nona into
the air and followed her myself with a leap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the cave we stood trembling with
fright, regarding the red monster of fire
that had eaten for itself an open pit in the
cave-floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona had forgotten to extinguish the fire
of our evening meal. These rocks were inflammable.
The fire had eaten its way downward,
as a fire on your Earth would eat
downward into a bed of coal, spreading out
beneath the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona and I did not reason it out that way
at the time. All we knew was that the red
fire-monster had broken loose, and we were
afraid of it. Blue and red tongues of flame
licked up from the mouth of its lair; its
hot, poisonous breath was stifling us even
across the cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was inactive only for a moment. Bidding
Nona keep away, I tried to throw dirt
into the little crater-mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the dirt had no effect. I might have
extinguished it with water you say? True,
I might, though I think now that the volatile,
highly aerated water would have been
of little avail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not try the water. I did not know
that water and fire were traditional enemies.
Nor did Nona. How were we to know
that, unless we had chanced to discover it
for ourselves, which we had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona screamed at me and I gave up my
futile efforts. The air in the cave was almost
suffocating; and with the instinct that
comes to any trapped animal underground,
we scrambled up the passageway to the
surface of the meteor.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was night, with silver Saturn filling
the overhead sky. Trembling, we stood
and watched the cave-mouth from which a
visible line of smoke was now issuing. Our
home was down there; the fire-monster had
it—and we could not go down and take it
from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We never went back to the cave. The
meteor’s swift days and nights passed in
rapid succession; and during several of them
we stood helplessly watching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the fire came to the surface. I
realize now that it was eating its way downward
as well as upward until the entire
vicinity of the cave was glowing with
molten, burning rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ground all around the cave-mouth
soon fell inward. A seething crater was
exposed where the cave had been—a bottomless
pit of lurid, licking flames with
black smoke rolling up from it, and the
hissing of steam below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We took instant flight, swimming through
the air over our tiny world, until, on its
opposite hemisphere we found sanctuary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no evidence of the fire here.
We were pleased. We would find another
cave, another river, and build our home
anew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were both famished. I caught a lizard
and we ate it—uncooked, for we were both
afraid to unleash again the monster that
had all but overcome us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we slept; and again, when two of
the meteor’s brief days and nights were
passed, and Saturn was sinking below the
horizon to give place to dawning sunlight,
we searched for a new cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No cave was to be found. But there was
water. A river several hundred yards wide
bubbled up from the ground and flowed in
a broad shallow stream toward the horizon.
We followed it to a tiny line of hills. Into
a hole in a cliff-face it plunged downward
with an impetuous current.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here we decided to build our home.
There were blue rushes along the river
bank. Nona gathered them; she would dry
them, plait them into robes for our couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once I flew back to the fire. I could not
get very close to it, for the air choked me.
The fire seemed to be burning itself out.
It was dull, with flickering puffs of flame
in the midst of a thick pall of smoke which
hung motionless in the still air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I returned to Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fire-monster is dying,” I said. “But
it has eaten our cave.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I know now what was happening. The
fire was being smothered for lack of
fresh air to sustain its combustion. Had
there been any wind I do not doubt but
that the entire surface of the meteor would
have been consumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An almost equally great danger threatened
us, however—and presently we were
made aware of it. The smothering, smouldering
fire gave off steadily a tremendous
volume of unconsumed gases. Even without
any wind they diffused themselves throughout
the meteor’s atmosphere, it was so small
a world, with so thin a blanket of air
about it—an infinitesimal fraction of the
air that envelopes your Earth. Rapidly it
became polluted with poisonous gases from
the half-smothered fire—polluted throughout
its entire extent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a day we were uneasy. Then we grew
frightened. There was little evidence of
smoke—only a blue haze. But the air
seemed to choke us. It was the poisonous
breath of the fire-monster come to make
us sick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We tried to go somewhere to escape it.
But we were on the opposite side of the
world from it already, and no matter which
direction we took, inevitably we approached
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except upward. We tried higher altitudes.
The air was purer up there, but also it was
thinner, and we could not live in it for any
length of time. Nor could we sustain ourselves
aloft indefinitely—to say nothing of
sleeping and eating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once in desperation we tried swimming
off the meteor into Space. But the lack of
any breathable air at all soon brought us
struggling downward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night there was a gentle wind. The
breath of the fire-monster swept up over the
horizon and came upon us with a deadly
blast. We woke up, choking. It was daylight,
with a small red-yellow sun dim and
blurred by the poisonous haze that enveloped
us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona was crying. But suddenly I laughed,
triumphantly, for I realized now that the
fire-monster could not harm us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were lying at the river bank. I seized
Nona in my arms and flung her headlong
downward into the water. And I plunged in
after her. The water here was deep—thirty
feet perhaps, as you on Earth would measure
it. With arms flying, we sank like stones
to the river bottom.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I was presently breathing the water
with fair normality. Indeed, after the
noxious air we had been struggling
with so long, it came almost as a relief.
Nona’s arms were about my neck; I loosed
them, but she clung to my hand. Together
we tried to stand upright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This river bottom seemed a gray sand.
But we could not maintain footing. The
water was empty—by which I mean there
was no marine vegetation here—nothing
that we could grip with our hands. And
from behind us, the current wafted us
gently but irresistibly forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I soon discovered that normally we would
float in an upright position. We held ourselves
so with our toes occasionally touching
the soil, bouncing along like feathers in a
gentle breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene around us now more resembled
a misty gray day on one of our sandy
Earth-deserts than anything else I can call
to mind. The ground was undulating gray
sand, sloping upward to one side, and with
a steady incline downward in front. And
down this slope we were blowing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swim, you say? It never occurred to
either of us! We were frightened; we
clung to each other, striving to remain
upright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very soon the light from overhead seemed
to deepen. But other light—the diffused
light inherent to the water itself—grew
brighter by contrast. We were swept forward
much faster—and down a much
steeper hill. I know now that the change
was caused by the river having plunged into
that cliff-face, to become subterranean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How far we were carried I cannot say.
A mile perhaps. Or more. Rocky cliffs
now seemed to pen us in; it was as though
we were in a steep canyon, with a powerful
wind driving us down through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then abruptly we came to the end of
the canyon. Open country lay before us.
There were hills in the distance, with the
level floor of the sea between us and them.
Long stalks of vegetation reared themselves
up through the water—so high that I could
not see to their tops—slender spires of
growing things, rooted below, branching
out above with huge air-bladders to keep
them floating—the whole waving slowly to
and fro. On some of them there seemed
what you might term fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a strange, but a beautiful and
peaceful scene. This, then, was our new
home—our new world! And how much
better, more hospitable, it was than the one
we had left! My heart swelled with pride
as, standing beside my mate, I gazed at our
new possessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small living thing—slender and elongated
and with a flat, waving tail—went
past us waist-high. I clutched at it clumsily;
but it eluded me and darted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the ground beneath our feet were
living things in shells. I seized one, ate it,
and called to Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sounds? It was very still and quiet down
here—but no more so than on the surface
of the meteor above. The sound of my
voice carried to Nona. Indeed, sounds here
in the water carried very far, though somewhat
muffled and blurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having eaten of the shell-fish, the berries
and the fruits, we lay down on the sand
with Nona’s hair floating above us. We were
in the shelter of a tenuous clump of ferns
which spread out like an arbor above us.
I twisted my leg in them to hold us from
possible drifting; and Nona clung to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We would rest and then build our home
here.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>How long we slept I do not know.
Nona brought me back to consciousness;
she was twitching at
my arm and whispering in my ear frantically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” I demanded; but she silenced
me. She was pointing with a trembling
hand. I saw what it was. Half a mile away
perhaps, over the sand hills, I could see
figures moving. Living things were advancing
toward us along the water-bottom!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat up, alert. Living things! I would
capture and kill one for food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as they came steadily closer, I saw
that each of them was nearly as large as
ourselves—and there were ten or more of
them. I trembled; and Nona and I drew
back into the fern to hide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The things continued to advance. Soon I
saw that they were upright, coming along
the sand as though walking, slowly but
steadily. I thought they had not seen us.
Nona and I lay very quiet, with our hearts
pounding with fright. Soon the things were
so close that I could examine them in detail.
They were apparently human as ourselves—made
after a general plan like our own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have since named them Marinoids—a
name that may serve as well as any other.
The males—or shall I call them men?—were
some five feet in height. Their bodies
were pink-white, smooth, with a glistening
skin. They were clothed—crude greenish
garments wrapped around them tightly.
They had feet and jointed legs, which, however,
were connected by a flapping membrane.
Their chests were over-large. There
were four arms, two at each shoulder. The
arms waved in the water sinuously, like the
tentacles of an octopus. At the ends of the
arms were fingers—very long and slim—and
a huge pincer, like that of a crab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet for all that, these beings seemed in
human form. The heads were hairy and
round, with two eyes only slightly protruding,
a nose, and a mouth not much different
from my own save that it was larger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women were slightly shorter and
more slender than the men, with long dark
hair that floated habitually above them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this party which now approached us
were ten individuals—four of them women.
In spite of their size, there was about them—both
women and men—a curious aspect
of <span class='it'>unsolidity</span>. I felt less afraid of them as
I realized it. They looked as though I could
crush them in my arms. Their chests especially
seemed no more than thin, inflated
membranes, expanding and contracting with
extraordinary rapidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wondered, with a sudden flush of triumph,
if these things would be good to eat.
I whispered it to Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can capture one,” I said confidently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait!” she cautioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marinoids were still walking toward
us along the sand—slow dragging footsteps
combined with a sort of waddle for their
legs were hampered by the membrane which
connected them. Their arms were waving
back and forth. The backs of most of them
were bent, with their faces downward as
though they were examining the sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must have made some movement. They
saw us! They stopped, and seemed to grow
suddenly alert. The men consulted together,
pointing at us; the women drew partially
behind them as though for protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I struggled upright, in spite of Nona’s
warning and her restraining hold. I would
fight these things—kill them for our food.
It would be a glorious feast; my Nona was
hungry.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I plunged forward. The Marinoids
were alarmed—startled would describe
their aspect better. The men stood their
ground; the women darted upward through
the water, swimming on one side with legs
waving the connecting membrane like a
great fish’s tail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the Marinoid men had shouted
something. I could hear his voice plainly—words
seemingly—a rasping order. Nona
was behind me, following me closely, ready
to help me fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick!” I shouted. “Catch one, Nona!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so futile! The Marinoid men left
the sand and darted at us so quickly that
we could not have eluded them had we tried.
They were upon us in an instant: I was
helpless as they threw me down and with
surprising strength in those three-foot long
tentacles, wrapped them around me and
held me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three of the men were thus engaged with
me; and two were holding Nona. But they
did not attempt to hurt us; indeed, they
seemed to avoid doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sixth Marinoid—he who had shouted
the order—was hastily gathering long, rope-like
segments of the vegetation. At his
command, Nona and I were raised upright.
The women came down to the sand and they
all inspected us curiously, talking among
themselves with words to us unintelligible,
but gestures which seemed wholly rational.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last they bound our arms tightly
against our sides and started us walking
along the sand. They were leading us away,
out over the sandy open spaces toward a
line of hills in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women swam above us; the men
walked in a group, pushing Nona and me in
front. We could run faster than they, and
once we broke away. But they swam after
us and caught us in an instant. And one of
them warned us with a gesture which was
unmistakable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon I saw what this party had been
doing before they encountered us. We passed
occasionally, huge receptacles made seemingly
of woven sea-vegetation. Into these
baskets they had gathered various living,
shell-backed creatures of the water-bottom.
And these baskets in turn would be gathered
up and carted away by other Marinoids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I learned this later; Nona and I understood
none of it at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we advanced, the aspect of things
around us changed continually. The vegetation
grew thicker, until soon we were in a
veritable forest of it. And we seemed to be
following a road—a pathway which had
been cleared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly I heard a shout ahead. The
Marinoid women swimming above us came
suddenly down. Our leader said something,
and they all drew back from the road,
pulling us with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shout ahead of us grew louder. A
moving object came into view—a sort of
sleigh made of a huge shell. It was gliding
over the sandy road toward us, pulled by a
strange swimming animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the sleigh were two Marinoid men—the
larger of them elaborately clothed. The
sleigh halted abreast of us. The smaller of
its occupants stood up and shouted vehemently.
And suddenly I realized that he
was shouting at me! My captors were lying
prone on the sand, and had pulled Nona
down with them. But in their excitement
and awe—for this was the ruler of their
world—they had left me standing alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stared stupidly at the angry figure in
the sleigh; and suddenly, in his wrath at
the effrontery of my upright posture before
his Monarch, he launched something at me.
I saw it leave his hand. It was long, thin
and pointed. It came through the water
like a spear thrown through the air. It hit
my head a glancing blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sank down to the sand. I heard shouts
around me—Nona was screaming. Then my
senses faded into blackness.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I take up my narrative at a point some
four or maybe five months (as you
here on earth measure time) after
Nona and I entered the world of the Marinoids.
The human memory retains only
high spots clearly; and those four or five
months held nothing which now impresses
itself strongly upon me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will recall that I had been knocked
unconscious by a blow on the head. When
I recovered, the ruler of that world had
passed on his way and our captors were
again dragging us forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We came presently to a city. A city, you
say! A city under water! Why not?
By a city I mean a closely-knit collection of
human dwellings where a large number of
people lived close together. Is that not a
city?</p>

<p class='pindent'>This one was the capital of the Marinoid
world. They called it Rax—a brusk, somewhat
guttural monosyllable which I write
with those three letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There we took up our abode with the
leader of this Marinoid party which had
captured us. There we learned the Marinoid
language, and became a part of the Marinoid
civilization—with friends and enemies,
hopes, fears and despairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I have already told you, our own
spoken language was no more than at its
beginning. We turned to that of the Marinoids
readily; and within a few months it
was to all intents and purposes native to
us. That you may understand this point, I
remind you again that our intellects were
matured but unused. We learned like precocious
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than that, this contact with other
beings with minds like our own brought us
rapidly up from the primitive mental state
in which I have previously pictured us. We
learned that one great trait of civilization—deceit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will picture us then—Nona and me—as
we were at the end of these months
with the Marinoids. We lived in a dwelling
near the bottom and outer edge of the
city of Rax. The bottom of the city! A
strange term! Let me explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here on Earth you live in a world you
call three dimensions—length, breadth and
thickness. By that, you mean your bodies,
and all material objects comprise three dimensions.
Perfectly right. But you live <span class='it'>on
the surface</span> of a globe. In general—with
exceptions of course—your actions take
place in but two dimensions. Your birds
move in three dimensions more than you do.
And your fishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fishes! There you see my point! In
the Marinoid world of water, to move vertically
came as naturally as the horizontal
movement. Hence, I say the bottom of the
city, for Rax had a vertical dimension almost
as great as either of its others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city was, I should estimate, of
roughly circular form some quarter of a
mile long and nearly as broad. Like a huge,
low cylinder standing on end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fibrous city of growing sea-vegetation!
Huge stalks planted like a thick
forest of trees in the sandy ooze of the
water-bottom, grew straight upward a thousand
feet or more. Broad, leaf-like branches
spread from them at the top, sustained in
an upright position by air-bladders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These upright stalks were the vertical girders
upon which the fabric of the city was
built. For eight hundred feet up they were
pruned of their branches. Parasite growing
vines had been guided laterally to connect
the vertical stalks. And upon these, other
rope-like vegetation was woven. The result
was a series of tiers some twenty feet apart—one
above the other—forty of them from
top to bottom of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tiers were further cut up into segments
which served as houses. I shall describe
one in detail presently—the one they
gave Nona and me at the time our great
event took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the city there were both vertical
and horizontal streets at intervals—up
and down and along which the inhabitants
swam or drifted. And occasionally there
was cubical open space—a sort of three-dimensional
park. One of these, the largest,
occupied the exact center of the city,
with the ruler’s home contiguous to it.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Have I made myself clear? The fabric
of this entire city—the very walls and
rooms of its honeycombed houses—was living,
growing vegetation of the sea. It grew
rapidly. It was easily trained to grow in
desired directions. A third of a man’s lifetime,
no more, would grow such a city as
this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One species of vegetation? No, there
seemed a hundred—each one of them had
its specific use and adaptability. It was curious
stuff. You have marine vegetation in
your great oceans of Earth. You may conceive
what this was like. Tough, smooth,
somewhat slimy main stalks. But porous—like
the stalk of your banana tree. The
leaves were intricate and beautifully shaped;
and there were millions of tiny air-pods
growing everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I first saw the city of Rax, I remember
marvelling at the ingenuity that
could build it. But soon I marveled at the
greater ingenuity that could maintain its interior
form. The main stalks changed little
from year to year. But a constant pruning,
altering, uprooting and replanting was
necessary throughout every detail. The very
walls of a man’s house were of varying
form. Yet, since each man was responsible
for his own, it was easily done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above the city, the great branches of the
main stalks spread out—green-brown wavering
things, a lace-work of great ferns with
hundreds of pods twice as big as a man’s
body—the air-bladders which sustained the
entire city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said the water was calm. Not a
ripple down here save those made by the
animate things themselves. Nature was passive.
The half-twilight never altered; the
temperature remained always the same; no
storms, not a sound of the world disturbed
its peace and calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus stood the city of Rax—tenuous,
wavering gently throughout its every fibre.
A city which, with one of your Earth-swords,
I could have cut loose from its
moorings and slashed to destruction. And
you shall hear how one day I did something
like that to a similar city. Not destroyed
it indeed, merely—but first I must
tell you what happened before the coming
of Boy—our boy, Nona’s and mine—our
little son.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We lived first in the home of
Caan—the leader of the Marinoid
party which captured us.
He was in charge of gathering the shell-food
from the water-bottom in the open
spaces beyond the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must sketch all this briefly—there is so
much to tell you. We were at first, curiosities
to the Marinoids. But we proved
our friendliness; and when we learned their
language they made us welcome among
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our history—what little we had to tell
them of the outer world of air, the meteor,
the heavens, the great Universe of which we
are all so infinitesimal a part—none of this
could they comprehend. But—and you of
Earth mark me well—these Marinoids did
not scoff. They were not unduly credulous
either. Their ruler sent for me; and with
a thousand ingenious questions sought to
test the truth of my words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am sure now that it was this knowledge
I held of things they had never dreamed of,
which raised me to a position of importance
among the Marinoids. That, and my
physical prowess, which very shortly I was
forced to demonstrate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At all events, I did become a figure of
importance in Rax. The ruler—an hereditary
monarch whom I shall call King for
simplicity—consulted with me frequently
after a few months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Boy was born they gave us our
own home. Caan had been very good to
us; we counted him our best friend. He
swam about the city with Nona and me
helping us to select from among the vacant
dwellings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can you picture us upon such a journey?
The horizontal streets were like square tunnels
twenty feet broad and equally as high—top
and bottom a tangle of woven, green-brown
vegetation, carefully pruned; sides
formed by the rows of houses. There were
windows and doors to the houses, with removable
screens of vegetation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The streets were artificially lighted. In
the open water outside the city there was
enough light inherent to the water itself to
give a sort of twilight. But within the city,
shut in by all this vegetation, it would have
been too dark for comfort. At intervals
along the streets a transverse strand of vine
was stretched. From it hung a huge pod—half
as big as a man perhaps. The pod was
a vegetable air bladder, of a variety whose
walls were exceedingly thin and translucent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From these pods, which hung like lamps,
a greenish-silver glow emanated. It spread
downward in a ray of illumination through
the water of the street; it cast queer,
blurred, monstrous shadows of the Marinoids
swimming past it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will be interested to know what the
light was. Small, self-luminous organisms
were gathered from the open water and
placed—hundreds of them—in the translucent
pods. Similar organisms to these
form the familiar “phosphorescence” of the
tropical waters of your Earth. But these
were much larger—more the size of your
glow-worms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We swam slowly along. A few Marinoids
were in the streets, passing us as
they went to their occupations. From a
window, or the bottom of a doorway, a
naked child would peer at us with big curious
eyes. In a horizontal street of more
pretentious houses, where the tunnel deepened
to two stories, a woman sat in the
corner of a little balcony, nursing her infant.
Beside her, two older children played
a game with shining opalescent shells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We turned upward into a vertical street.
You would call it a huge elevator shaft.
Its lights were fastened to the sides of
buildings. Here the houses were one on
top of the other—a single low story only,
and very long horizontally. Nona did not
like them; one was vacant here and Caan
suggested it but she refused it decisively.
I had no opinion to offer; they all looked
all right to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We swam upward and soon reached the
central cube of open space. Here was the
ruler’s palace. Open water surrounded it
on all four sides, and on top. The main
stalks of the building grew above it with
graceful hovering fronds of green—fronds
whose smallest pods were luminous like a
hundred tiny Chinese lanterns—under
which, on the roof of the building, was a
garden. There were small plants growing
there, gleaming white shells laid out in
designs, a bed of black ooze with brilliant
red things like flowers growing in it. A
row of small illuminated pods formed a
parapet to the roof top.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The main building was not as large as
the term “palace” sounds—it was not
over fifty feet in its greatest dimension. It
had both vertical and horizontal balconies,
and a broad horizontal doorway near the
top—a doorway built of shimmering iridescent
shells plastered together with mud
and a gluey substance which was made from
one of the Marinoid plants. And on a
tiny platform by the doorway lay the shell
sleigh with its marine animal and its driver
in waiting—the sleigh in which I had first
seen the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to us a magnificent dwelling, this
palace. Nona and I floated before it, gazing
with awe. But my heart sank, for I
knew that now Nona had seen it, we
should have much more difficulty in selecting
our own humble little home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed, almost the time of sleep
before Nona made her choice. She selected
a two-story house, at the intersection
of a horizontal with a vertical street. It
had one room upstairs, and two downstairs—small
rooms, you would call them,
no more than fifteen feet cube.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the house had a little horizontal
balcony upstairs. On it Nona could lie
and watch the people passing. And Caan
told us that these streets were on the route
the King habitually used when leaving the
city with his equipage. I think it was the
balcony that decided Nona. For myself, I
was pleased because we were only a very
short distance from the home of Caan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our room of sleep had bunks built into
the wall—bunks which were soft with a
springy growing mass of mattress—a grey-white
growth which <span class='it'>you</span> would call a
sponge. There was a large ornamental
shell standing like a table in the center of
the room; and a window giving onto the
balcony and the street. The window had
a leafy, swinging blind for privacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For ventilation we left the window open.
Ventilation, you say! Ventilation in a city
of water! Most assuredly. Your most
humble fish will die without fresh water.
We were using the air held in solution by
the water; and fresh water with new air was
constantly necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once, after each time of sleep, the whole
city was “ventilated.” Swimming animals—sleek
shining things of brown, with
slimy bodies like wet seals—pulled a sort
of shield rapidly back and forth through
the streets. The shield was large; it almost
filled the street. Its movement stirred
the water; pulled the water by suction into
the city from outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was describing our house, but there is
so much to tell you I must be briefer.
Downstairs we had circular shells to recline
in and a place to store and prepare our
food. And every room was lighted with
a pod which had a green-moss shade that
could envelope it when darkness was desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona was delighted with the house and
immediately began planning a hundred ways
to improve it. The place was in good repair,
but there was much pruning and retaining
of the vegetation to be done. And
then, when we had slept in the house but
once, and were both busily engaged with
our own affairs, Og came to see us. He
came to see Nona, I should say—for certainly
<span class='it'>I</span> never liked him. His coming was
the immediate cause of my being forced to
display my physical strength—to which occasion
I have already alluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I fought Og twice—the first time in a
pretentious hand-to-hand combat before the
King’s palace, which attracted the attention
of the entire city. It was a queer combat—unfortunate
for me. I shall tell you
about it at once.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Og stood in our little doorway,
talking to Nona. He was a young
man about my own age. I have
since learned he was not full-blooded Marinoid—but
that can come later. He was
somewhat taller than Nona, but shorter
than myself. His legs, with their connecting
membrane, were bare to slightly above
the knee. From there to his shoulders, he
was dressed in the characteristic Marinoid
fashion—a single-piece garment of green
woven grass. On his bulging chest he wore
an ornament—a flat, circular affair of many
tiny shells linked together. His four, tentacle-like
arms waved before him. The hair
on his head was thick and matted, but short.
With one of his pincers he would occasionally
brush it—a gesture evidently intended
to impress Nona with his grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og’s face—with features not much different
from my own except that his mouth
was larger and his eyes slightly protruding—was
nevertheless most unpleasant. His
chin was weak, his expression egotistical;
and more than that, I never liked the way
he looked at Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A queer sort of being—this Marinoid—for
me to be jealous of! If you are thinking
that, you are wholly wrong. We were
living in a Marinoid world, and in all that
world only Nona and I were queer-looking!
<span class='it'>It was we who were abnormal, not they!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona, with her flowing hair and her
short grey-green Marinoid jacket, was to
me the most beautiful creature in the world.
But, as Caan pointed out, our eyes—Nona’s
and mine—were set too deep in our head
to be of real use in seeing sidewise. Our
mouths were too small to admit the water
comfortably, and our chests too small and
immobile to handle it properly. Two arms,
which could bend in only one direction,
were surely not so advantageous as the four
Marinoid arms; and our legs, without the
connecting membrane, would keep us always
very indifferent swimmers. This was before
I demonstrated my muscular strength; Caan
changed his opinion a little after that.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I have wandered from Og. Nona unwittingly
attracted him, in spite of her
physical handicaps. I know why now. He
was a half-breed; the blood in his veins
which was not Marinoid barred him from
finding a mate among the Marinoid women.
And when Nona came he wanted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not know this at the time, but I
sensed it. And Nona too was afraid of Og,
though she had not shown it outwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was in the other room this time when
Og came to our new home. He stood there
talking to Nona; and suddenly I heard her
scream. I launched myself in a dive
through the inner doorway. They were up
near the ceiling and Nona was struggling
with him. He was laughing; he dropped
her, and came swimming down to face me,
still grinning insolently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is tempting,” he said. “She has
learned the ways of the Marinoid women
very quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I swam at him, but he avoided me; and
before I could seize him, Caan appeared in
the doorway and stopped me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona was crying. Caan would let me
do nothing. Physical altercations were a
dire offense in Rax. I could report Og
for trial and punishment, but I could not
personally attack him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his insolent confidence, however, Og
did the one thing I would have wanted.
He swam at me and struck me lightly in
the face with the side of his left-front arm.
It was not so different from one of your
old customs here on Earth. He had challenged
me to public combat. A duel? Call
it that, if you wish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan made all the arrangements. We
were to fight after the next time of sleep,
in the open cube before the King’s palace,
with the King, Queen and young Prince on
the palace roof to judge us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona was frightened; she cried all that
day. At Caan’s suggestion we slept that
next time in his home, where his wife (I
use the term wife, although it is inapplicable)
could care for Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The combat was to be without artificial
weapons—and in spite of Nona’s feminine
fear—I could not take it seriously. I was
only twenty, you will remember, and youth
is absurdly confident in itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan, however, was very grave. I did
not know it at the time, but the combat
was intended to be to the death. Og understood
it so—and the whole city was
stirred by it. As for the King, it would
be an interesting sport for him as spectator;
a thousand times of sleep had passed
since such a sight had been offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan was very kindly to me that evening,
solicitous and perturbed. Once he started
to question me about my methods of fighting.
Youth is so foolish! I laughed at
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall twist him in my hands before
he can touch me,” I said boastfully. “We
will not talk of it now, my friend, Caan.
It frightens my Nona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once he subsided. He had indeed
something important to tell me. But my
words chanced to make him think I knew it.
The Marinoid is by nature reticent; he
will force nothing upon you—offer no advice
that you do not solicit. I was as it
happened entirely ignorant of this thing he
feared; had I not been I should have
looked forward to the combat with alarm
and probably terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona would not go to the scene. But
Caan went to represent me, and lay on the
palace roof beside the King.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The cube of water was a brilliant, gay
arena. Illuminated air bladders were
hanging from the palace balconies and
from the foliage above its roof-garden.
Everywhere about the cube, top, bottom and
all four sides, these lanterns were banked
in rows, so that the open water in which
we were to fight was a bright, greenish glare
of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the roof-top there were perhaps ten
Marinoids in addition to the Royal Family.
They were reclining behind the row
of lamps; and these lamps were shaded
like the footlights of one of your theatres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the cube, facing the palace, were
a few balconied houses of the more important
inhabitants of the city. Their lights,
too, were shaded to throw the beams outward
toward the open water. These balconies
were all crowded with Marinoid
men and women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At every street entrance to the cube other
Marinoids were crowded; a hundred or
more of them lay prone on the lower surface,
their gaze directed upward. And
above, a swarm of others clung to the roof
of the arena, or hovered in the foliage, staring
downward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King’s sleigh was gone from its
platform; a group of his guards stood there
instead. Occasionally one would swim out
to warn back a trespasser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Caan and I arrived, the figure of
Og, nude save for a loin-cloth, was hovering
alone near the center of the open
water; his legs were moving very slowly,
his four arms waving as he sustained himself.
Every eye in the crowd was upon him.
His face bore a confident, leering smile—the
challenger waiting for his opponent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shouts arose as Caan and I pushed forward
through the crowd. Caan took my
outer garment, and with a grave word of
encouragement, left me. My gaze followed
him as he swam upward to join the King’s
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hush fell upon the crowd. The water
now was soundless; then suddenly Og
called to me—a sneering shout of defiance.
I was not afraid; I was sorry Nona was
not here to see me fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly I mounted upward through the
empty water to meet Og. And then the
Queen did a curious thing. Her soft but
commanding voice rang out over the stillness;
she ordered me up to the roof-top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I obeyed, hovering respectfully before
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope that you will win,” she said
softly, yet loud enough so that all might
hear. “You are badly equipped to fight—but
you are in the right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was some applause, for Og was not
popular in Rax; but she silenced it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go—do your best.” She dismissed me
with a gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I was turning away, my heart swelling
with pride at the incident, the young
Prince—he was about my own age, and
had already shown some liking for me—called
out softly but vehemently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo, do not let him touch your head
and feet at the same time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I said, “and I thank you both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I swam slowly back to meet Og. I had
no idea what the Prince meant; but I followed
his warning as well as I could, until
in the heat of the fight, as you shall see,
I forgot it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og was waiting, facing me alertly. His
arms and legs had ceased waving; his body
was tense; he was sinking slowly downward.
I followed him down with no more than
ten feet separating us. I wondered when
he would come at me. I would wait; then
grip him around his chest and crush him
with my superior strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence in that bright, glaring water
was oppressive; we were sinking nearly to
the bottom of the arena. Without warning,
I doubled my body and dove forward—rushing
at Og with all the strength I
could put into my swimming strokes.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I was a good swimmer; there are none
like me among the humans of your
Earth. But I soon found I was not
the equal of Og. He eluded my first rush.
With his arms close against his sides, his
body slipped between my outstretched
hands. He mounted upward—a pink
streak through the glaring water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was after him. Up in the foliage, almost
directly over the King, he hovered,
waiting for me. The contemptuous smile
on his face maddened me. As I came up,
he turned sidewise into another dive, but
I gripped his ankle as it went past me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd was shouting as we floundered,
churning the water. I was trying to
turn and clutch Og around the body. But
he twisted away. I knew, if I could once
get him in my grip, I could crush him.
But he seemed to know it also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I still held his ankle, and he did not
try to kick himself loose. He seemed to be
manoeuvering for something. He was
swimming forcibly downward now, using
his arms but leaving his legs limp. It drew
our bodies through the water in a single
straight line, like one boat towing another.
Then Og turned into a sharp circle. I still
clung to him, and his body, bent like a
bow, went over mine. The movement
brought his head near my feet. One of his
arms swept down, made a clutch for my
ankle, but missed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard the shout of mingled horror and
relief from the crowd. I was now above
Og. Our turning movement confused me.
The bottom of the arena was over my head
in another instant; then the side and top
swung past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og made another clutch at my ankles;
and warned at last of some danger which
I did not understand, I dropped him
abruptly and swam away. He did not
chase me, but turned over a few times
more and then hovered in the center of the
cube.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the upper foliage I swam. I was
breathing heavily. My chest seemed constricted.
I was not physically able to undergo
such exertion without distress. I
realized it. The excess oxygen my blood
was demanding could not be obtained by
my lungs from water. I would have to
get my grip around Og at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the spectators were now shouting
at me derisively. They thought that
after this first encounter I was now afraid
of my adversary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afraid? I was beginning to be in truth.
I ground my teeth, and turning, head downward,
again dove for Og. He waited,
quietly; he was tense again, his body slowly
sinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten feet from him, I brought myself
up short. We faced each other, both sinking
gradually. Once he slid forward, and
made a pass at me with an arm. But I
dove away, returning at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were nearly at the bottom of the
arena when Og suddenly threw all four
arms above his head. His body was bent
forward, crescent-shaped. It seemed to be
my opportunity. I rushed at him. He retreated;
and as I came into an upright position
for another lunge, his body bent over
me like a bow. One of his feet touched
one of mine; and simultaneously his fingers
struck my head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a brief instant I was conscious that
his touch seemed to burn. A tingling shock
ran through me. Then, inert and unconscious,
my stiffened body sank slowly to
the bottom of the arena.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I recovered my senses, and heard
dim voices around me. I did not open
my eyes, but lay quiet, half in a
dream. I remembered the combat; I
thought, perchance, I was dead. I recall
now how vague musings floated through my
brain. I had been alone on a meteor—then
I found people—civilization. Unhappiness
and strife had come with them. To be
really happy and at ease, one ought to be
alone in his world. And yet, there were
friends to be found as well as enemies.
There was Caan, and the Marinoid Prince.
He was my friend; he had warned me
against Og. And there was love to be
found, too. Nona!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought of Nona stirred me to fuller
consciousness. The voices around me
seemed to grow louder. I opened my eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was in a bunk at Caan’s house. Caan
was there beside me—and an old, bent Marinoid
whose work I knew was the care and
treatment of the human body in distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona was sitting on the bunk close to
me; her wonderful golden hair floated
above us. Her face was white and set. As
she saw me stir and open my eyes, she
burst into sobs. My arms went up to pull
her down to me. My Nona! And Caan.
My friend Caan was gravely joyful to see
me come back to life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Marinoid was talking quietly
to Caan about me, and then he left. Nona
lay in my arms; presently the Prince sent
a messenger to inquire if I were recovered.
My cup of happiness was full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was far into the next time of sleep
after the combat before I had regained my
senses; and throughout all that time Nona
and Caan had been beside me. I did not
seem greatly injured. I was soon strong
enough to talk with them, to find out what
Og had done to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was simple, and when I understood it
I shuddered at the danger into which I had
so rashly and ignorantly rushed. Og had
shocked me into insensibility with a bolt of
animal electricity. The bodies of all adult
male Marinoids contain special electrical organs
for the generation of it. The bolt can
be released at will; its control is entirely
voluntary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og had manoeuvered, I recalled at once,
to get me into the right position to receive
the maximum shock. His body was bent
over me like a bow; he touched my extremities,
with his extremities simultaneously;
and the current, passing through my
body, had all but stopped the beating of
my heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan had thought I was on my guard regarding
this. My words had made him
think so; and I had refused to discuss the
fight. And the Prince had meant to warn
me of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had indeed, heard of this natural
weapon possessed by the Marinoids. But
in my youthful confidence I had forgotten
it, for the use of it against a human except
in public mortal combat was a dire offense
against the Marinoid laws.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>You are amazed and perhaps incredulous
at this physiological fact?
You need not be—a very similar condition
occurs on your own Earth. Indeed, only
the ignorant can dare be rashly incredulous.
In your own waters, as you would know
if you ever bothered to apprise yourself of
the fact, there exists the electric eel. Your
learned men call it <span class='it'>gymnotus electricus</span>.
It uses against its enemies very similar
tactics to those Og used against me. And
with very similar results, for it can kill
or stun a fish much larger than itself.
Many an ignorant native fisherman in the
smaller streams which empty into your
Orinoco River, has learned this fact to his
cost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, to multiply instances, you have the
<span class='it'>torpedo</span> and the whole family of <span class='it'>rays</span>. It
was from them your scientist Galvani made
his study of the electrical properties of
muscles and nerves, applying his discoveries
to the higher animals and to man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was soon recovered—and a wiser man
than before. And I swore to myself that
never again would I ignore the proffered
advice of a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first desire was to fight Og again
at once. With the knowledge of what I
must avoid, I knew I could defeat him. I
went to the place he lived, but he was not
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news that I wanted another combat—which
was my right—spread through the
city. Og had doubtless hoped I would die;
when I recovered, and searched for him,
he could not be found. After the next
time of sleep, I learned he had left Rax.
Shell-fish gatherers, working under Caan,
reported seeing him swimming alone toward
the Water of Wild Things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not return. The region known
as the Water of Wild Things was where
he had been born, some said, and his only
relations were among the half-savage beings
living there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was content. With Og gone—my
second fight with him, indeed was postponed
for a considerable time—there was
nothing in Rax to disturb my own and my
Nona’s happiness. We had our home, our
love and our son.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I go back again in my memories to
that year in the underwater Marinoid
city of Rax—the year of quiet and
peace for Nona and me which followed the
birth of our son. Boy, we called him;
everyone called him that, for he was the
only child of his kind in our world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a wonderful, happy time for us
both. In all the Universe there was never
another like our Boy. So thought Nona
and I. Pink and white, with his laughing
blue eyes, and soft blond hair on his little
head, he would lie cradled in the big white
shell that stood in the center of our living
room. The tiny bits of vegetation which
often floated in the water past his face were
his toys to snatch at and demolish; and
Nona, who fed him, crooned to him, and
when he was no more than a month or two
old guided his baby flounderings into swimming
strokes, was the center of everything
around which his infant world revolved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For myself, almost an outsider with these
two, it was enough to watch them playing
together, to see the light of motherhood
in my Nona’s eyes, and the glory of it on
her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time—unmarked by daylight or
darkness down here in the water—glided
by; and for us the passing days meant only
that Boy was growing larger, his limbs were
lengthening, his neck would now support
his head, he could swim and soon he would
begin to talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus can happiness exclude one from the
world around. Yet it must not be inferred
that we lived at home in complete seclusion.
There were happy times with our
friend Caan and his family—in his home
when Boy would lie there asleep and we
others would play at a game of floating
shells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there were other times when I went
hunting with the Prince. He seemed to
like me—and his friendship I must confess,
was to me a great joy and pride. Like
many another Prince of your own Earth,
Prince Atar was a sportsman. Occasionally,
heading a little party of his friends, he and
I would hunt together, swimming toward
the Water of Wild Things, where, over
the cliffs which bordered the Marinoid domain,
strange fearsome creatures would
sometimes trespass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My means of livelihood? Oh yes, I
was a worker like the rest. There was
no place in Rax for a drone; and Nona and
I were by no means guests of the city—no
longer than the first month or two. When
they gave us our home I was assigned to
work with Caan. After each Time of Sleep,
we swam out with our baskets into the open
spaces beyond the forest which surrounded
the city. We would gather up the shell-food
that lay on the sea-bottom. It was
continually sifting down from above, and
what we collected was later gathered and
driven in to Rax, to the government storehouses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan’s wife worked with us—for women,
even though married, were obliged to work
for the public good a portion of the time.
After Boy was born Nona, too, often joined
us—though this was not obligatory, for
the care of infant children discharged a
woman of the debt of working otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is so much that my memory holds
to tell you of this strange Marinoid civilization!
But you, with your life to live at
high speed, would weary of me if I were
not careful. You want everything at a
glance—and you shall have it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me say then that during this peaceful
year there were occurring in Rax a series
of mysterious incidents of an exceedingly
sinister character—incidents which shortly
were to lead us into the most stirring and
critical period of Marinoid history. But
we did not know this at the time. Life—wherever
in the Universe it may be found—runs
on a similar plan. It’s like a puzzle—a
jigsaw puzzle whose picture remains undefined
until you fit the last segment into
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was with these ominous events
that now occurred one by one in Rax. (And
the absent Og, I may say, was at the bottom
of them.) Each in itself seemed relatively
unimportant. Yet all were part of
a plan of destruction that was menacing
us like an unseen sword hung suspended.
We awoke to a realization of the danger,
finally. You shall hear how it was I, who—when
the thing at last struck home as a
personal tragedy to me—played a leading
part in the stirring scenes that followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I ask you first to bear with me a
moment more, while I give you a very brief
summary of conditions in our Marinoid
world? I know you will chafe. A thousand
supposedly pressing duties of your
own super-civilized life are forcing themselves
upon you even at this moment of
relaxation. Set them aside, I beg you. They
are not nearly so important as you think.
If you were to die tonight, leaving all of
them undone—your world would go on as
placidly as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment then—and you shall have action
and movement to your heart’s content.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The region of the Marinoids was a
stretch of water bounded by great
rocky cliffs on all sides. It was
subterranean water—by which I mean that
by ascending in it one came at last to
a rocky ceiling. We were, at Rax, near
the center of this subterranean sea. What
was its extent, I cannot say. All measurements,
all standards of comparison, were
lost to me. In depth—at Rax—it might
have been two thousand feet or more from
the sea-floor to the ceiling above, which is
to say some two or three times the depth
of the city itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How many entrances there were from
the outside world, I do not know. Through
one of them Nona and I had come when
Caan and his party first encountered us.
To the Marinoids, who were not explorers,
the idea of a surface to water was inexplicable.
They could not conceive of such
a thing; they could not understand it when
I tried to explain it to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were several Marinoid cities besides
Rax, but none nearly so large. And
there was—shall I say a rural?—population.
In the great forests, Marinoid dwellings
were occasionally to be found—isolated
huts of sea-weed, clinging like bird-nests
to the wavering branches of the trees.
And in the open water other scattered families
of a more adventurous turn, lived in
huge shells from which they had excavated
the living tissue—or lived in holes hollowed
out of the banks of black ooze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boundaries of the Marinoid domain
presented themselves as almost perpendicular
cliffs—dark, jagged rock, with slabs and
banks of black clay, mounds of coral, red,
black and white, or a tangle of slimy vegetation.
Openings which were caves—a cliff-face
honeycombed with them. And the
ceiling was of similar character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the boundaries—the one nearly
opposite to where Nona and I had entered
this world—was somewhat different. Here
the cliff-face rose to over three thousand
feet. But here also, the ceiling was even
higher, so that between them there was left
an opening a hundred feet or more in
height, and a mile, at least, in horizontal
width. It was a fearsome opening. Its
floor seemed to extend backward and downward.
The water in there was black; a
thick slimy ooze was under it. And there
seemed to be in it the suggestion of a noisome
stench that lay beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the entrance to another region,
of unknown extent—the Water of Wild
Things as the Marinoids called it. What
might lie in there, none could say. A few
had penetrated into it a short distance, and
returned with lurid tales which none believed.
And others had gone and never
come back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that there were half-savage humans
living there, everyone believed. Og was
bred of them, some said; and now that
he had voluntarily gone there to live, as
rumor had it, so much seemed a certainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange animals occasionally came from
the Water of Wild Things. A sea-monster
had come once. But that was in the dim
past, remembered only by legend. The
monster had all but overcome the cloud of
Marinoids who had desperately set upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the conditions under which
we, at Rax, were living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I am ready to tell you of
that series of incidents which awakened
us to our danger. They did not at first
concern me personally, and so I paid them
little heed. That is a commentary upon
your own life, is it not? Soon the thing
struck home to me with its tragedy. Ah,
then how different it seemed! We can bear
the grief of our friend so much more
philosophically than our own!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The first of these incidents in Rax came
when Boy was about two months old.
A young virgin, the daughter of one of
Caan’s worker, disappeared. She was a girl
somewhat younger than Nona. She was
beautiful, in Marinoid fashion. To you, all
these Marinoids must seem grotesque—unhuman
perhaps. But beauty is not universally
standardized—only locally. We admire
our own kind. Your natives of Zanzibar
think their own black-skinned, thick-lipped
belles the most beautiful on Earth.
And as I have said once before, in the
Marinoid world the Marinoid women were
the standard of beauty. Nona, so different,
was the exception, the abnormality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This girl who disappeared had been with
one of Caan’s scattered parties working on
the sea-bottom, gathering shell-food. She
had wandered away from the others, and
when the time came to return to Rax, she
was missing. We thought she might have
become ill and gone home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was not at home—nor could she
be found anywhere in the city. Even this
did not arouse much interest, except to her
own immediate family. It was thought
that some young Marinoid man had taken
her for mate. According to custom the
couple might readily have disappeared for
a time—gone out together to live in the
forest to escape work until their first period
of love was past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there seemed no young man unaccounted
for—and the girl did not return.
Even so, the incident would have been forgotten,
but soon another young girl disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were perhaps thirty who vanished
during that year. They were not all from
the workers outside the city. We had long
since ceased to take women with us; and
those who lived in the forests and the mudbanks
came crowding into Rax—and to
the other cities nearby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We knew very soon, of course, that our
Marinoid women were being stolen. And
there was one crowning incident that at
last made us understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at what you would call midnight,
when the city was asleep. Caan and I,
on a belated errand, were swimming down
one of the vertical streets. The place was
deserted; the street was empty; the lights
at intervals on the side walls of the houses
illumined the water with a green, diffused
glow—like lights in a thick fog at night
on your Earth. The windows along the
street for the most part stood open. Everywhere
was heavy silence, with only the
swish of the water as Caan and I swam
through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A green figure in the horizontal street
below us attracted our attention. It seemed
to be a man swathed in a green cloak of
seaweed. He saw us coming, and darting
up to the street light which hung nearby,
he flung something over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light was obliterated; shadows fell
over everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan and I were startled; we hung
poised, just above the cross-street so that we
could see along it in both directions. There
were lights at distant corners. We heard
a low but penetrating cry from near at
hand. A signal! Other figures in the distance
darted up through the water and put
out the lights. The entire street was in
darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan and I whirled downward, shouting.
Through the window of a house, we
saw the stiffened body of a woman come
floating. There was light enough for us
to see her white face and arms—a woman
unconscious, shocked into insensibility as
we later learned, by a bolt of animal electricity
from her abductor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her body floated from the window as
though pushed from behind. In the darkness,
green swathed forms seized it—forms
which were barely discernible as blurs in
the dark water—seized it and began rapidly
towing it away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan and I were after them. Our cries
were arousing the city. Voices—confused
questions—came from within the houses.
Figures appeared; the street behind us was
in a turmoil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman’s body with its almost invisible
assailants was moving forward rapidly.
Lines of white as the highly aerated
water was stirred, radiated out V-shaped
from its rapid progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Caan and I, unburdened, could swim
the faster. We overtook the invaders.
There was a struggle in the darkness. A
bolt of electricity went through me, but I
recovered from it. Caan was shouting in
hot anger as he struck at the green shapes
that were attacking him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water all about us was lashed into
white. It caught and reflected the light
from a suddenly illumined window near at
hand. I found myself gripping Og!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my voice seemed to inspire him to
frenzied effort. He jerked away from me—was
gone into the shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan was now shouting triumphantly.
He had dispersed his adversaries. The
woman’s white body—neglected—had sunk
to the floor of the street. We swam down
to her, chafed her arms and neck until at
last she recovered consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The street was relighted. The houses
were emptying themselves of their frightened
inmates. A crowd gathered around us
with confused startled questioning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Og and all his cohorts had escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, when I returned home,
Boy was lying in the hollow white shell
which was his cradle, crying lustily. And
Nona—my Nona—was gone!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The hours that followed were a
confused horror and despair to me.
Yet there seemed no one but myself
and Caan who considered this disaster
more vital than those which had preceded
it. At last we knew that the young women
of Rax were being stolen—from under our
very eyes—from the heart of the city, in
the silence of the Time of Sleep. We knew
now also, that they were being taken into
the dread Water of Wild Things. Og’s
presence proved that. Og had gone to
live with the fabled humans, half-savage,
that legend said lived with the monsters
of that strange dark region. And now Og
had come back—and had been caught in
the very act of an abduction. It was all
clear now. And all we had to do was to
guard our women—to watch carefully the
entrance to the Water of Wild Things,
that nothing, human or savage, could come
out of it to trespass on the Marinoid domain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ran the sentiment of the city; and
the King, making a speech from the parapet
of his palace roof-top, assured us in
flowing phrases that the danger now was
past. No marauders could come from
the Water of Wild Things now that we
were on the alert to stop them. He, our
Monarch, assured us of that. Our women
in future, were secure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Nona been safe at my side, no doubt
I should have applauded these sentiments
as did most of the other onlookers. But
Nona was not at my side. She was gone—into
that horrible unknown region from
whence none returned. The King said
Marinoid women now were safe! What
was that to me, with my Nona gone?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was talk of an expedition into the
Water of Wild Things. But none would
volunteer, save those comparatively few
who already had lost wives or daughters.
Caan stood by me. He would go. And I—there
would have been no sleep or food
for me again had I tried to stay in Rax and
yield up Nona to her fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no artificial weapons available
in Rax save of one type—that slim
hunting spear made of fish-bone—the spear
with which the King’s attendant had struck
me down when first I was being brought to
Rax. These spears were all the Prince
and I had had for our hunting expeditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other weapons? The Marinoids had had
them in times gone by. But once—a lifetime
before—civil war had broken out between
two of the Marinoid cities; and
when it was over all weapons save the
simple spear, were abolished. There seemed
no need of weapons. There was practically
no wild life in Marinoid waters. The
monster that had once come to devour
them was a fable out of the distant past.
And so they lived on in a false security
making themselves defenseless so that they
would not be tempted to fight; and forgetting
that their very defenselessness must
prove an irresistible temptation for some
enemy to attack them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We organized our meager, pitiful little
rescue party. Led by Caan and me—with
Caan’s wife to care for Boy while we were
gone—there were no more than fifty of us
in total. Then, quite without warning,
Prince Atar signified his intention of joining
us—commanding us in person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can you guess the joy it brought to my
heart? Our Prince, disregarding even the
commands of his father, was coming with
us!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar—for so I called him now in the
intimacy which had come between us—was
younger than myself. A slim, clear-featured
youth, with a boyish smile, but eyes
which had in them the look of one born
to command. And Caan—a man past the
zenith of his life, whose arms were no
longer limber with youth but with a body
strong and sturdy nevertheless. With these
two to help me I felt that I could conquer
whatever strange creatures we might encounter—and
get my Nona back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our party was no more than together,
when Atar announced we were making a
mistake. There were fifty of us, practically
unarmed. We were too large a party
to go anywhere in secret; we would, by
our very numbers, be but provoking an attack.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Atar’s plan, in brief, was that he,
Caan and myself, should slip quietly
into the Water of Wild Things and see
what conditions were there. Then, perhaps
without ever having been seen or forcing
an encounter, we could return and plan an
expedition in greater force—a force sufficiently
great to insure success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To me, whose one and only desire was
to follow Nona and get her back, the
Prince’s words seemed rational indeed.
What did I care for the safety of those
other Marinoid girls who had been stolen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prince, nevertheless, was right from
every angle, and so it was decided that we
three should go alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall never forget the scene as the
Prince parted from his mother on the roof-top
of the Palace. We were going to what
everyone considered almost certain death.
We would go, and they would never see
or hear from us again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with these Marinoids there were no
heroics. No shouting and applause as the
heroes went forth to battle. That is left
for you really civilized humans who wage
war after a more vainglorious fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These Marinoids, crowding every corner
of the cube of open water before the King’s
palace, hovered in silence as we prepared
to leave. And the silence deepened as the
Queen stood before her son, and he knelt
at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodbye, Atar,” she said; and her
glance included Caan and me. “We will
wait and hope—for you to come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her arm brushed his sleek head as he
rose and turned away. We departed; and
her brave, inscrutable smile followed us,
as between those silent, solemn ranks of
spectators we slowly swam along the streets
and out of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently, with tumultuously beating
hearts, we three with only our slender
spears, were approaching that dread black
opening which marked the entrance to the
Water of Wild Things.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We entered the opening,
swimming in a group with Atar
leading. It was already new
territory for us. Our hunting expeditions
had never taken us even as far as this;
we were always content to remain in Marinoid
waters. As we advanced, the rocky
ceiling overhead was closing down on us,
until soon there was no more than twice
the length of our bodies between it and
the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On both sides the dark water stretched
out as far as we could see into blackness
also. We were descending now at an angle
of perhaps forty-five degrees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had gone what you would call a
mile possibly, when we came suddenly to
a tangle of coral—a barrier that reached
from floor to ceiling. I call it coral. It
might have been a petrified vegetation. An
all but impenetrable thicket—white like
the frosted underbrush of your Northern
winter forests—it seemed to bar our further
progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stopped; consulted, and swam to
the left and right. But the tangle extended
in both directions to the edges of the mile-wide
passageway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is this,” said Atar, “which keeps our
own region free of monsters. They cannot
easily pass a barrier like this.” He was
smiling at Caan and me. “To this, perhaps
we owe our safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan was poking at the thicket, and we
found after a moment that we could with
difficulty force our way through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The realization that Atar’s words brought
us was at once reassuring and alarming.
If no creatures of the wild could pass this
barrier, what then might lie on its other
side?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan, older and more poised than either
Atar or me, was wasting no time on such
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” he said. “Here we can get
through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white underbrush must have extended
for several hundred feet back and
downward. We forced our bodies through
it, seeking small orifices, bending aside
the twigs, or breaking them off for they
were very brittle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were an hour or more getting
through. A few small bottle-shaped fish
with protruding, ball-like eyes on the sides
of the head, lurked here and there. They
watched us curiously—unafraid, almost resentful
it seemed, with their sidelong
glances and their hasteless movements to
avoid us. But we paid them little heed,
for such as they often wandered into Marinoid
waters and were easily killed with our
spears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tangle of white underbrush gave
way at last into open water. Again we saw
the ceiling and floor close together—the
same narrow slit sloping sharply downward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the white underbrush gone, the
water seemed darker—so dark that we
could hardly see each other a few lengths
away. It was warmer too—unpleasantly
warm; and to our nostrils came the taint
of that stench now unmistakable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had been swimming downward for
what seemed an interminable time when
abruptly the floor beneath us dropped away
into a perpendicular cliff. Simultaneously
the ceiling had heightened—disappeared
into the watery shadows. We found ourselves
poised with a vast void of ink before
us. It might have been illimitable for all
we could see of its boundaries. And empty!
There was nothing but blackness—but it
was that pregnant blackness that seems,
not empty but merely to conceal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must go down,” said Atar. I could
hear that he was trying to keep his voice
steady. “They would live—down on the
sea-bottom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We descended along the side of the
perpendicular cliff. A thousand feet?
Three thousand? I cannot say. The water
grew steadily warmer until its heat began
seriously to oppress us. The thought
came to me suddenly that we were well into
the bowels of my meteor; its internal fires,
now very close perhaps, were heating the
water. My meteor! How remote the outside
world—the outer surface—the Heavens—Saturn—the
stars and the vast, unfathomable
distances of the Stellar Universe—seemed
to me now! I had been
born out there somewhere. It was the first
time in ages that such a memory had crossed
my mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” cried Caan softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We huddled together against that black
cliff-face. Below us in the void, a glowing
point of light was moving. It seemed miles
away; but it was no more than twenty or
thirty feet, for as it approached we saw it
was a long, sinuous thing with an illuminated
head—a head that glowed phosphorescent—luridly
green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We held our breaths. The thing went
past us—quietly, without seeming to notice
us. It was a ribbon-like thing thirty feet
long, two feet high, and no more than a
few inches thick. A pallid white ribbon of
puffy slime, frayed and tattered at its edges,
it undulated gruesomely from end to end.
In a moment it was gone, into that void
of ink from whence it had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again we descended. Other creatures
passed us—headless things of black with
illuminated parasites clinging to them;
great fishes, star-shaped, with a brilliant
green head in the center and each point
of the star as long as our bodies; fishes,
or were they animals? that were all head, it
seemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We took heart, for none seemed to notice
us. But there was a balloon of white jelly.
It floated past us quite close. It was larger
than any one of us. It seemed harmless
and Atar swam beside it. Then suddenly
the thing expanded, lost all its form and
like a cloud of white mist, enveloped him.
He screamed and we rushed to his rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant we were all three plunged
into a confused, frantic horror for which
I can find no words. Like thick white glue
that was sticky, yet slimy, this almost imponderable
stuff fought with us! Fought, I
say—for it was using an intelligence against
us! We floundered, flailing the water with
frantic arms and legs. A noisome stench
from the gluey stuff sickened us; the feel
of it made our flesh crawl and the gorge
rise in our throats. It was uncannily flimsy
stuff. We could tear it into shreds, fling it
away; but always it came back, to weld itself
together. There was an intelligence
in it! Not a centralized power of thought,
like a brain, but an instinct for battle that
must have been inherent in every smallest
fibre of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We escaped at last. How, I do not
know. Perhaps the thing wearied of us.
And as we struggled away exhausted, with
its horrible gluey particles which we had
breathed in choking our lungs—we saw it
floating off, ragged but still balloon-like, its
original shape almost unimpaired.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>We reached at last the bottom of
the void. It was not level, but
tumbled as though some cataclysm of nature
had tossed it about. Banks of black ooze,
a hundred feet high, were honeycombed
with holes; valleys were beside them—valleys
bristling with stalactites of black and
white coral which stood up like pointed
spears to impale the unwary trespasser.
And there were miniature volcanic-looking
peaks—cone-shaped. From one of them a
stream of water almost hot, was issuing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frequently now, we saw lights; and all
of them were the naturally lighted heads
and bodies of swimming creatures. They
moved about lazily, confidently, ignoring
us; and we knew that when they were hungry
they would feed, either upon others
smaller of their kind—or upon us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over this tumbled, broken sea-bottom—where
occasionally a giant crab or something
of the kind would scuttle from a
shadow into one of the deeper shadowed
holes—we swam at an altitude of about
fifty feet. We carried no light; and our
bodies were shrouded in green-black cloaks.
We still held our spears—poor, useless, futile
things! Yet, as Atar said, they might
not be useless against humans. And it was
the humans, with their greater intelligence,
that we now feared most. Conditions of
life here in the Water of Wild Things,
now became plain to us. These wild creatures
were for the most part inoffensive up
to the point of satisfying their own need
for food. They fed upon each other and
thus reduced their number. The humans,
in open battle with them, were doubtless
helpless. But the humans had the intelligence
to hide—to escape. And the creatures
of the wild did not bother unduly to pursue
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does this seem illogical to you? I assure
you, it is not. The conditions we
found, here in the Water of Wild Things,
in the bowels of that meteor flying amid the
Rings of Saturn, were almost identical with
those which prevailed in the early periods
of your own Earth’s history. There is not,
and never has been, a wild creature as
predatory, as ferocious as Man himself.
Your lion and tiger are cowards unless
spurred by fright or hunger. The wild animals
of your Earth would have been glad
to live at peace with Mankind. It has been
Man himself who consistently has been the
aggressor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See there!” cried Caan softly. “Is that
perhaps a place where humans live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below us, in the distance ahead, were a
number of tiny pin-points of light. And
even as Caan spoke, a human figure passed
near us—a figure swimming swiftly downward
with a fugitive, frightened speed. It
seemed to hold a sort of lantern in one of
its hands outstretched—a small, shrouded
light to guide it through the darkness. It
did not see us, and in a moment it had
passed downward into the shadows. But
the moving point of its light remained
visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come!” urged Caan softly. “That will
show us the way. Hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We swam downward, following the
point of light.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The light ahead of us winked like
a will-o’-the-wisp as intervening
branches of coral, the edge of a
mud-bank, or perhaps the body of some
living creature, momentarily blotted it out.
We were close to the bottom now. Along
here it was a rolling, but fairly even bank
of ooze, with grotesque squat plants growing
in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light could not have been more
than a few hundred feet in advance of us;
in its glow we could sometimes see the
outlines of the human figure carrying it.
We did not dare speak aloud now; we
swam with that speed and silence which
only one who lives in the water can attain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the light dipped downward and
vanished. We saw that this figure we were
following had entered a black cave-mouth—an
opening which ran diagonally down
into a slimy bank of mud. And we saw,
too, that the points of steady light which
had first attracted our attention were the
reflected glow of illumination from somewhere
beneath the sea floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently we slipped into the cave-mouth.
The moving light was down there: then
abruptly it disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait!” whispered Caan. “Go slower!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We advanced cautiously—and came
again to a hedge of coral which impeded
our passage. But this barrier we saw at
once was artificial. It was the crude doorway—created
by human intelligence and industry—which
barred the creatures of the
wild from entering. We threaded our way
through it. Any one of those sea-monsters
could have battered it down had he known
his strength. But such a knowledge is given
only to Man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the barrier the dim glow of a
diffused green light became visible. We
edged cautiously forward, turned a corner,
came suddenly to a ledge, and stopped—breathless,
with wildly beating hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were looking down from near the
ceiling of a cave. The water filling it was
lighted with a pale green radiance, that
lent a ghastly, wavering unreality to the
scene. The cave might have been several
hundred feet in width—nearly circular—and
shallow, a hundred feet perhaps from
floor to ceiling. The opposite wall to us was
plainly visible. It was gouged out with
niches in ranks and tiers—shallow ledges
like the houses of your ancient, most primitive
“Cliff-dwellers.” We could see little
family groups squatting on many of them—humans,
not unlike the Marinoids in form—men,
and women, and children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was none of this that caused our
hearts to leap so wildly. The floor of this
community house was at the moment
crowded with human figures. The figure
we had followed in was swimming downward
to join them. On a raised platform—a
shelf of ooze at the side and bottom of
the cave—several old men were sitting.
They were not Marinoids—but they seemed
to differ principally in the eyes, which were
much larger and more vacant, and in the
pallid, ghastly whiteness of the puffy flesh
of their bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same platform stood Og! He
was gazing down at the throng of people
before him—haranguing them. His voice
reached us—not Marinoid words, but
enough like them—a corruption—to make
them intelligible to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this we saw at a brief glance. And
the crowning thing: On the platform also,
between Og and the white old men, my
Nona was sitting with her arms bound
at her sides! My Nona, beautiful as always,
pink skin, blue eyes and golden hair—so
vivid amid that pallid, ghastly
throng! And she was unharmed—with
spirit unbroken—I could see that by the
flash of her eyes, her scornful, unwavering
gaze as she leveled it at the puffy white
faces staring up at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Nona!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>We crouched there on that upper
ledge, staring down through the
green water of the cave, and listened to Og
as he harangued that pallid, puffy-faced
throng. His words came up to us clear—words
which, as I have said, were not Marinoid
but a corruption of them sufficiently
close to the original to be intelligible to us.
We listened, breathless. What we heard
made the past plain to us; and made our
own future—the danger hanging over all
the Marinoids—equally plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment we forgot our own position
there on the ledge—forgot even Nona
whom we had come to rescue and who was
sitting behind Og on the platform, arms
bound at her sides, with scorn on her beautiful
face and her eyes flashing fire at her
captors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Og, with vehement, enthusiastic
words, was explaining to these, his own
people, how he would soon lead them into
battle against the Marinoids! Rax and its
sister cities would be captured; the Marinoid
men killed or reduced to slavery; and
all the beautiful, peaceful Marinoid domain
turned over to the rule and the enjoyment
of Og and his people!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It made us shudder; but we held ourselves
quiet. Caan, older than Prince Atar and I,
pulled us back when in our eagerness to hear
Og’s every word we would have pressed
thoughtlessly forward and risked discovery
from below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These people called themselves Maagogs—two
long, very harsh syllables. Down here
under the Water of Wild Things, hidden
away in caves, mud-holes and subterranean
tunnels, there were doubtless thousands of
them—dragging out a furtive existence,
menaced on every hand by monsters of the
deep. To them, Nature herself must have
seemed an inexorable enemy, as though their
very being were against her laws, her wishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For centuries they had apathetically struggled
on. And then, as though to blot them
out entirely, Nature had turned on them
still further. Of recent years the pallid,
dull-eyed Maagog women had borne but one
female to three males. The Maagog women
were dying out; soon the race would become
extinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this dearth of women of their kind,
Maagog men of the more prepossessing appearance
(a generation before) had smuggled
themselves into the Marinoid race.
Their children—half-breeds—were living
there now, with their Maagog heritage unsuspected
by the trusting, simple-minded
Marinoids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this and more, Og explained to the
throng of Maagogs he had assembled before
him, as he outlined his plans of what he
now proposed to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet!” murmured Caan to Atar and me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og’s voice went on. He had left Rax and
come back to the Water of Wild Things because
he loved his own people. It had been
his idea that they steal the Marinoid women.
The Maagog race must go on—on to conquest,
to victory!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cheer rolled out as he said it. But we
who listened knew it was Og’s own personal
advancement—and not love of his
people—which actuated him. And his very
next words made that plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He—Og the Executioner—would lead his
people to victory. And he would rule them
as King. Og the Executioner! Thus he referred
to himself. We did not know at the
moment just what he meant. But, as you
shall hear, we were soon to learn in very
ghastly fashion.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>War with the Marinoids was coming!
Og had sent messengers down
with his tidings. The messengers were coming
back; and from everywhere came the
news that the Maagogs were willing to
fight. If their present rulers would urge
them on (and here Og turned to the white
old men behind him) the Maagog people
would mass themselves at Og’s command—would
follow him against the Marinoids.
And when victory had crowned their efforts,
he, Og, would rule them in Rax—the most
beautiful spot in all the world—where they
would all live in peace and security forever.
And the beautiful Marinoid women would
be their women, and the Marinoid men
would be their servants and their slaves!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a vigorous, exhilarating speech, and
the crowd on the cave-floor responded to it
with prolonged cheering, while Og stood
silent, smiling upon them triumphantly.
Then abruptly he turned toward Nona—my
beautiful Nona—who with spirit still unbroken
flashed back at him her look of contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again Og spoke. This woman—this
strangely fashioned woman he had found
among the Marinoids—would be his Queen—to
rule with him when they had conquered
Rax. He approached Nona, laid his
hand on her shoulder. I started forward;
but Caan held me back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet, Nemo! Wait! If they discover
us, we are lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my Nona did not shrink away from
Og. I knew that every fibre of her revolted
at his touch—but she did not show
it. Her gaze on his face was steady—and
full of that same cold contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This woman,” said Og, as he smiled
down at the listening throng, “will be your
Queen. She is frightened now. She will
soon see how great am I—how great is
the honor I offer her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was talking for Nona’s benefit, I
knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I respect her,” he said. “I shall conquer
the Marinoids first—and she—her love,
her admiration—shall be my reward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned away from Nona, and, advancing
to the very edge of the platform, held
out his arms to the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—Og the Executioner—will rule you.
The waters we will conquer are fair and
beautiful. Cool and open—room for us all—and
free of monsters. Riches for every
one of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheering halted him again. The crowd
was waving its thin arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” whispered Atar to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From across the cave, a niche halfway
up the opposite side, a Maagog woman
launched herself into the water, swimming
downward toward the platform and Og.
She seemed not much older than Nona—a
girl not unlike a Marinoid girl, but dead
white of flesh. And puffy, with huge staring
eyes and a mouth that was a gash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swam downward slowly and landed
upon the platform close beside Og. He confronted
her. She spoke to him, pleadingly—but
so softly that we on the ledge could
not catch her words. Then she gestured
toward Nona; and then she threw her arms
about Og’s neck. He struggled to release
himself, while the crowd, silent now, looked
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment, and Og was free, standing
erect. The Maagog girl was lying on the
platform where he had thrown her. She
rose to her feet painfully, flinging at Nona
a glance of unutterable hatred. Then again
she appealed to Og—a gesture of love, despairing,
desperate. It seemed to madden
him. He stepped forward and struck her
across the face with the flat of his arm.
She fell backward, righted herself in the
water, and swam slowly, limpingly away.
A moment more, and she was back in the
wall niche from whence she had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og, with a scowl, went on talking to
the crowd—telling them of the coming
Marinoid war. Never once did he look up
to where the girl was crouched above, watching
him silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I—my gaze was no longer for Og.
Across the cave from me—almost at the
same level and almost as far from Og and
Nona as I was—that Maagog girl crouched
tense. There seemed something ominous in
every line of her—something that filled me
with a dread—a horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og’s speech rolled on. The crowd applauded.
Atar whispered something to me—something
about us three going back to Rax
at once, to get help to rescue Nona and to
prepare for the coming war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I did not heed him. That girl on the
rock across the cave was still crouching
there. The baleful gaze of her huge eyes
was downward to the platform—and my
heart leaped into my throat when suddenly
I realized that she was staring, not at Og,
but at Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I saw her hand go to her
grotesque green robe. It came back; her
pincer held a very short gleaming spear—like
a dagger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd was silent, hanging now on
Og’s words. Of all that throng, only I
was watching that menacing figure on the
ledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly the silence was split by a
scream—the Maagog girl screaming as
though at last her rage and jealousy had
broken the bonds of her reason. I saw
her dive, head downward—diving and
swimming, with the blade extended—straight
for Nona!</p>

<p class='pindent'>My own reason left me. I leaped forward,
thrust back Caan and Atar who
would have stopped me—and plunged from
the ledge—plunged downward in a long,
swimming dive toward the platform where
my Nona sat bound and helpless!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Plunging head downward, it
seemed as though the platform,
with Og, Nona and the white old
men upon it, was sliding swiftly upward at
me. To one side, level with me, the Maagog
girl was coming down also; we two
formed the sides of a V, converging at
Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It all happened very quickly; no more
than a few seconds went by as I made that
downward plunge—yet during that time my
head whirled with a thousand frightened
thoughts. And one of them stood out predominant.
The Maagog girl, in murderous
frenzy, would reach Nona first; would
stab her to death before I could intervene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was conscious that the crowd had fallen
silent. Behind me, high overhead now, I
heard Atar shouting. Soon the platform
was close under me. The Maagog girl, too,
was close—unswerving, seeming not to have
seen me. A spear, thrown by someone in
the crowd—a crude, heavy sort of spear—came
up at me, but I avoided its ponderous
flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og in alarm, had slid away; the white
old men were cowering. Nona’s face was
upturned to mine. I twisted sidewise, flung
myself at the Maagog girl. Our bodies
met; the impact threw us both down upon
Nona. The Maagog girl screamed again,
but her screams were almost lost in the
shouts that now came from everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was hardly aware of intercepting the
blow of that dagger. It struck my forearm—seared
me like a fire-brand. But then
I caught the girl’s wrist, twisted the weapon
from her. She screamed again, screamed
with baffled fury. The water around us
was white with her struggles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar was beside me! “Quick, Nemo!
Nona is free! Nona, come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his spear-edge, Atar had cut Nona’s
bonds. The Maagog girl was swimming
away, still screaming. A figure came at me—a
Maagog man, with Og prudently behind
him. I plunged the girl’s spear into
the figure’s bulging chest, and waved my
spear at Og as the Maagog sank at our
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overhead, Caan was poised in mid-water,
shouting defiance at the frightened crowd.
I turned. Nona was free! She was mounting
upward toward Caan, with Atar covering
her retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo! Nemo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Nona’s voice. Og was backing
away, looking for a weapon with which to
attack me, and shouting at the crowd to
head me off. I mounted after Atar and
Nona. Higher up, Caan was now fighting
a Maagog who had risen to attack him.
Then the Maagog’s body slowly sank, with
Caan’s spear buried in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another moment we were again on the
ledge from whence we had come—and my
Nona was safe with us! For a brief instant
I held her in my arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Caan was dragging us all back into
the passageway. Below us the cave was in
turmoil. Og had gathered around him a
dozen or so who had weapons. They were
coming after us! Frightened groups surrounded
the bodies of the two we had
killed. One of the white old men had
recovered himself and was bawling orders.
And over it all the Maagog girl was
laughing and screaming with hysterical triumph
because Nona had escaped Og and
was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo! Come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ahead of us lay the dark passageway with
its barrier of coral. Beyond that, another
length of passageway upward to the open
Water of Wild Things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We swam hurriedly forward, but my arm
was still around my Nona. Soon we were
in the coral barrier. Behind us, down the
passageway, we could hear Og and the
others shouting as they followed us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We threaded our way through the coral,
slowly, laboriously, as one would force a
way through the thick frozen underbrush of
your winter forests on Earth. But it was
a shallow barrier—two hundred feet
through, no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again we were in the open passageway;
and Og and his party were approaching the
barrier from the other side. We hastened
onward and upward. It was a short distance
only, and we were at the mouth of
the tunnel. The open Water of Wild
Things loomed before us. Somewhere up
there through that inky void was the entrance
which would lead us into Marinoid
waters.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Atar gripped me, as with Nona beside
me I would have launched myself
out of the tunnel-mouth. And I heard
Caan’s low exclamation of dismay. A light
had leaped out of the blackness—a single
huge light of green; and then, behind it, a
myriad others. Like tiny green stars they
dotted the void.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had no time for conjecture. The
darkness out there took shape—a sinuous,
serpentine shape. The thing was coming
toward us. Its huge head seemed to radiate
green fire; the body and tail behind the
head were black, but like barnacles, a thousand
luminous parasites clung to it, and
glowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We drew back, but not before the serpent
had become aware of us. It turned
over with a long, gliding undulation and
came at the mouth of the passageway. But
it came hastelessly, lazily, as though in its
own good time to pick up this food that
was offered. I caught a glimpse of opened
jaws—fangs half the length of my body.
And its breath, a fetid stench, seemed to
precede it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trembling, we flung ourselves back down
the dim tunnel. Ahead through the coral,
the vague reflected radiance from the cave
was visible. In the coral we could hear Og
and his followers, calling to one another as
they threaded their way through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no choice. The narrow walls
of the passageway hemmed us in; behind us,
the serpent was gliding quietly forward. We
swam back to the coral. A Maagog forced
his way out, and instantly I drove my spear
into him. He crumpled with a gasp, and
sank in a heap with the spear impaling him
from back to chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned, and Nona pushed me to one
side. A small black opening was there—an
opening at right angles to the main
tunnel. It was barely three feet wide and
twice as high. Caan and Atar were already
in it. Nona glided in, pulling me
after her. We swam back a dozen feet
and paused. The green head of the serpent
was out there in the tunnel we had left; it
loomed there a vivid spot of light, at the
entrance to this narrow slit which sheltered
us—a head too large to enter. It stayed
there a moment, and then, as though yielding
to the inevitable, it quietly withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how far, we did not know. We were
terrified and confused. Nona was trembling
violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must go on,” said Atar. “Not back
there to that—thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ahead of us this narrow, slit-like tunnel
seemed to broaden. It was almost black,
but not quite, for the mud itself was faintly
radiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We pressed forward, around a turn to
the left, then another to the right. The
water in this confined space was foul; it
hurt our breathing. We hastened, to get
out to the open water as soon as possible.
We hoped we would strike it some distance
from the mouth of the other passageway—enough
to be away from the monster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How far we went I do not know. Occasionally
the tunnel branched, but we always
took the larger. We turned several times—ascending,
then descending again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last a glow showed ahead. The open
water, but with a monster on guard there!
Our hearts sank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly, around a sharp curve, the glow
brightened! We slid forward, came to the
end of the tunnel. From a tiny, shelf-like
ledge, we stared down into the self same
cave we had left so precipitately half an
hour before! Still up near the ceiling, but
now on its opposite side!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>How can I make clear the dismay,
the confusion that swept over us
at this unexpected outcome to our
supposedly successful escape? What could
we do? Retrace our way back through the
winding tunnel? There were many diverging
passageways: we would lose ourselves
hopelessly in this honeycombed mud-bank.
And before us was the cave, into
which we could not venture without the
practical certainty of capture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too bewildered to do otherwise, we
crouched and stared down into the cave. It
was less crowded now, but there were still
a hundred or more Maagogs on its floor,
and dispersed about its wall niches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across from us, almost at the same level,
was that other ledge on which we had formerly
perched. Behind it, its tunnel
showed as a small circle of blackness. Perhaps
we could swim across the cave unnoticed—get
into that other, now familiar,
passageway—then through the coral barrier
and into the open water.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To safety.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Unless the monster were still there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar aroused me from these thoughts. He
was pointing downward into the cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo. Caan. What is he doing
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the platform, Og and three of the
white old men were gathered. Around
them a small school of fishes was swimming.
Ten or twenty fishes—short, squat
things, two or three feet long, smooth, dull
black skins, and with huge distended
mouths. For all their size there was about
them an aspect of extraordinary strength—their
powerful squat build, the alertness of
their movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My heart almost stopped with the sudden
realization that these fishes—or were
they fishes?—were not swimming aimlessly,
but were waiting for Og’s command! Like
a pack of trained animals they circled about
their master. Then Og called to them.
They answered with full-throated, yelping
cries! Fishes with voices, you exclaim?
You need not be amazed. There are “shouting
fishes” even in your own waters of
Earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og was bending over the shell where
Nona had been bound. The rushes that
had bound her and which Atar had cut,
were still lying there. At Og’s call these
swimming creatures gathered around him
eagerly. The sound of their voices—yelping,
whining—was blood-curdling. Og was
raising up the severed bonds—holding them
out; and the fishes were smelling of them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in a pack they gathered; and Og,
leading them, swam with them across the
cave up near its ceiling to that other ledge
from whence, with Nona, we had made
our escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black fishes entered the other passageway,
with Og and half a dozen other
Maagogs after them. As they swept down
into it, their gruesome cries died away into
the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You, with your knowledge of similar
things, will doubtless think it stupid of us
to be puzzled at the meaning of all this—at
its danger to us. Yet—we had no way
of knowing. We stared at each other, relieved
that these ugly black things which
uncannily answered Og’s commands, had
disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo! You are hurt!” It was Nona,
who now had noticed that my arm was
bleeding where the Maagog girl’s dagger
had ripped it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.” I said; and I wiped it against
my robe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We tried to plan what we should do.
Could we cross the cave? The Maagog girl
was still down there, near the platform,
with eyes alert to everything around her—eyes
that still smouldered with hate and
jealous rage. No. To enter the cave would
be to court almost certain discovery. We
would have to retrace our way—find some
other tunnel to lead us out into the open
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were starting back, had gone perhaps
a hundred yards, when far ahead of us
down the narrow passageway, we heard
sounds. Yelps! Cries! Whines! Not human—the
cries of those squat fishes with
their huge slimy jaws!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Panic seized us. We darted back toward
the cave. Then forward again, trying to
find a side tunnel. But along here there
was none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yelps grew louder; Og’s voice mingled
with them. And then, before we
could decide in which direction to go, like
a pack of eager hounds following a trail
and come at last upon their quarry the black
fishes swept down upon us. I tried to fight
them off—tried to protect Nona. But they
darted about me, under me, over me, and
gripped me from every side. Teeth like
needles, ripping, tearing at my flesh.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Og’s
voice shouting a command.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Caan screaming
a warning at me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then something
heavy struck my head. Silence and blackness
descended upon me.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I recovered consciousness to find myself
lying in a bed of mud in a dim,
cave-like room. My first sensation was one
of heat; the water I was breathing was hot,
stifling. My head throbbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona, Caan and Atar were gathered over
me, waiting anxiously for me to recover my
senses. Nona, hearing my weak voice, seeing
my eyes open, threw herself down beside
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was not greatly injured. Og had struck
me on the head with the flat of his spear.
It had cut my scalp and raised an ugly
lump. Besides that, the flesh of my legs,
arms and shoulders was torn by those fishes’
teeth as if by needles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plight of Caan, Atar, and even my
dear Nona, was similar—but with none of
us was it serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They told me now, that we were captives.
Back there in the tunnel Og had
called off his attacking fishes—called them
from us or we would have been torn to ribbons.
Then, floating me with them, the
Maagogs under Og’s direction had brought
us here to this small room adjacent to the
main cave—and left us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat up, then swam a little. I was all
right! Nona was all right—we were all
safe and sound! My hopes revived. Why
should we not now escape?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But none of my companions reflected my
jubilant mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him look around,” said Caan to
Atar. Never had I heard Caan speak so
sourly, so despondently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did look around. We were in a black
mud room some forty feet square and half
as high. It was bare of furnishings; and
lighted overhead by a crude sort of illuminated
bladder that gave off a dull green
glow. On one side against the black wall
were beds, hollowed out of the mud. To
<span class='it'>you</span> they would have looked like shallow
graves; and in one of them I had been lying.
Across the room was a shelf of mud
with a dozen clay seats on it—like a row
of huge toadstools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A third side gave into a tunnel. I approached
it eagerly; then drew back shuddering.
That pack of blood-hound fishes
was out there, circling back and forth, on
guard. They saw me, and darted lazily forward.
As I stopped, they seemed satisfied,
and went back to their endless circling, following
every twist and turn of two or
three who seemed to lead them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan laughed cynically. “Not there,
Nemo, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My arms went protectingly about Nona,
and she drew me wordlessly to the fourth
side of the room. The wall here was gone.
A grating of woven seaweed like prison
bars, took its place. I stood on a precipice,
gazing through the bars into a black void
of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can I make you understand the shuddering
fear that possessed me? This water out
there was moving swiftly downward, like a
torrent, or a subterranean waterfall. Its
current, drawing the water out of the room,
flattened me involuntarily against the bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had never seen swiftly moving water before.
I felt as <span class='it'>you</span> would feel gazing from
a great height into a dizzy abyss. And this
water I could see, was boiling hot down
there. But for those bars, I should have
been whirled down into it! And from far
below I could hear a faint sizzling, as of
water dropped on a bed of embers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I forced myself away from the grating,
back into the center of the room; and now
I was aware that all the water in the room
was coming from the tunnel and passing in
a current through those bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” said Atar, trying to speak
calmly. “You see now—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Og abruptly entered from the tunnel.
He hovered before us, leering. Nona shrank
against me, and I folded her in my arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og did not glance at Nona. He said to
Caan: “Have you decided?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Caan answered. “He is but this
moment recovered. We—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him now. I will wait.” Og turned
away, swam over to the grating and gazed
through it to that boiling, tumbling water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Caan told me. Og offered us freedom—us
three men. He would send us
back to Rax. The price of it was Nona’s
promise to be his Queen—a willing, smiling
Queen, none other would the Maagogs
have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could feel Nona shudder against me,
but she said no word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” I shouted. “No! No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og heard me and smiled. “There is
another way. Tell him, Caan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if we did not agree—if Nona did
not give her promise—Og, the Executioner,
would open the grating and let us three
men slip out—down into that boiling water
our helpless bodies would be sucked.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Caan said it, my Nona burst out:
“And Nona, too. <span class='it'>That</span> is best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even that, Og heard. “No,” he
smiled. “Not Nona. She will stay here
with me—to rule as Queen when I have
coaxed the smiles back to her pretty face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was suddenly aware of another figure
in the room. That Maagog girl had slipped
in from the tunnel. She heard Og’s words.
Her face smouldered with fury; but it was
Nona, not Og, at whom she gazed so balefully.
And I knew then that if ever Nona
were left with Og—if we men were killed—this
woman would kill Nona if she could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og faced the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Maaret? Why do you come
here?” He addressed her gruffly. “Did I
not tell you to stay away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gestured behind her. “The time is
on us. They are ready—coming now. And
Og, I knew that you had forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og grinned. “Yes, girl, you speak well—I
had forgotten.” It was doubtless very
amusing; he was chuckling as he whirled
on us who were hovering in a huddled
group. “A fortunate occurrence, my
friends from Rax. You shall swim aside
now—and watch me as I perform this little
duty of mine. You shall see how
cleverly, how gracefully I do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still grinning; his voice was
ironical, mocking—but his eyes were gleaming
at Nona. “It will help <span class='it'>you</span> to decide,
my Queen—help you to choose the fate of
your Nemo, your little toy Prince Atar, and
your Caan the shell-gatherer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were sounds in the tunnel now—a
low wailing, monotonous, like a chant, a
dirge. Og waved us imperiously away.
Maaret, the Maagog girl, led us to the side
of the room near the grating. We followed
her, but I kept myself between her and
Nona. And there, flattened against the
mud wall, we watched and listened.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The wailing swelled in volume, then
ceased abruptly. From the tunnel a
line of figures came swimming—Maagog
women, eight of them. Each held a child;
an infant hugged to the mother breast; two
or three older little boys dangling in the
water held by the mother’s hand; and one,
a boy almost half grown, swimming close
by his mother’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children were all naked—puffed,
dead-white little things, with goggling eyes
and gaping mouths. One or two were crying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The line slowly passed me, swung about,
and went to the platform. On that row of
toadstool seats the mothers took their places.
They sat there drooping, hugging their children.
The older boy huddled against his
mother’s knees; his face, turned my way,
showed great, staring eyes, dark with a terror
but half understood. He was whimpering
a little, but his mother silenced him
with a low-spoken word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og, swimming slowly, went the length of
the line, counting the women, searching
their faces and the faces of the children.
Evidently he was satisfied that all who
should be, were there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are ready?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My gaze, following his, swept the line.
A woman sobbed; another clutched her infant
hungrily; but they all nodded assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You first,” said Og abruptly. He darted
an arm at one of the women. A tremor
shook her; a shudder; but obediently she
held out her infant to Og. He took it,
swam with it to the grating, and opened a
little gateway that was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he held the infant poised, his glance
turned to me; his eyes were grinning sardonically.
Atar was cursing softly. I
started forward, but Caan held me back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use, Nemo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og’s arms went up; he slid the infant
through the little gateway. I heard its
mother scream; but my eyes, fascinated,
were on that black, tumbling void of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby’s body, caught by the current,
floated out and downward—slowly at first,
then more swiftly. Gradually it turned
over.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. An infant face—big eyes full of
staring surprise.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a puny wail of protest as
the water grew hotter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down it went, whirling now—a tiny
white blob.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. white, then pink—then turning
red.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sank back, sick and faint. And Nona,
who had not looked, whispered tremblingly
to me the meaning of it all. There were
too many male children being born to the
Maagogs—too many useless mouths to feed.
After each tenth time of sleep, male children
were drawn by lot in the different
community houses and sent up here to this
death chamber for execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og the Executioner! How efficiently,
with a smile on his lips, he performed his
grisly duty!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>You</span> read of this with a shudder perhaps?
You marvel that in even so remote a hole
of the Universe as this Water of Wild
Things in the bowels of my little meteor,
such ghastly, inhuman things should take
place? You forget. Can you not recall that
on your own fair Earth, not so very long
ago, they cast infant girl-babies into the sacrificial
waters of the Granges, to the hungry,
eager jaws of the crocodiles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not look again. Occasionally there
was a sob—a scream; once, a brief, despairing
scuffle as some mother found the ordeal
beyond her strength. The little half-grown
boy, as he passed me with Og’s hand in his,
gazed at me with a dumb, terrified appeal
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hated myself as I looked away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then—it was all over. The little gateway
was replaced. The mothers—empty-armed—swam
silently out into the tunnel,
through the parted ranks of those alert-eyed,
guarding fishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maaret, the girl, had disappeared. Og
was again alone with us. His lips were
leering triumphantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see how well I do my work?
Quickly—without confusion.” The leer
abruptly faded into grim menace; his eyes
blazed at us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may take your choice. The hot
water, there—” His gesture was to the grating—“Or
the cool, sweet water of Rax. But
in either case, Nona shall be my Queen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned away. At the tunnel entrance,
he paused. “Soon I shall come back for
your answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gone.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>What were we to do? With
such a choice, what could we
say? Soon Og would return for
his answer! The water of the cave still
seemed ringing with his grim, sardonic
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hopelessly we sat down for discussion.
Nona sat on one of the seats where but a
few moments before a Maagog mother had
dropped and yielded up her infant to the
boiling torrent beyond the grating. I shuddered
and pulled Nona away. On the
floor, near the center of the cave, we gathered
in a huddled group. I braced my feet
in the mud, for the current pressed us toward
that ghastly grating, beyond which
lay death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cave was silent save for the sinister
hiss of steam beneath it. In the lurid
green glow of the lamp overhead our faces
were livid, death-like. Death hung all
about us. An unseen, imponderable spectre,
it seemed to lurk in the very water
we breathed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were alone—yet not alone either.
At the tunnel-mouth those squat black
fishes circled back and forth on guard. Occasionally
two or three would enter the
cave. Poised before us, their eyes seemed
gauging us. Uncanny eyes! Eyes almost
like those of an intelligent dog whose master
has set him to guard an enemy and who
is watching suspiciously, expectantly, that
enemy’s every move. We lowered our
voices subconsciously, as though fearing
that the black fishes would hear us and
understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first we had little to say. It was all
so hopeless. We could not allow Og to return
us to Rax and yield up Nona to him.
That was unthinkable. And yet, if we
did not— The memory of those infants’
bodies as they slid downward into the boiling
torrent made us shudder with a fear
that is implanted deep in every human
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cowards? I do not think you could call
us that. But the man who tells you he
has faced death—in a calm moment of
physical inactivity—without fear, is a liar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were all of us afraid, numbed, confused.
Abruptly Atar laughed. But his
laugh was hollow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must plan something,” he said.
“We sit here like terrified children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Caan who outlined the situation
for us. “Og,” he said, “undoubtedly
wanted us to accept freedom. He could
easily kill us now and keep Nona; but he
wanted Nona’s promise to be his willing,
smiling queen. None other would the Maagogs
have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We could, therefore, count upon Og’s
returning us three men to Rax, if that were
our choice. But could we? It was I who
voiced the question. Caan had suggested
that possibly we could get to Rax and return
at once with others to help us rescue
Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do we know that Og will not
betray us at the last moment?” I demanded.
“How easily can he take us to the entrance
to Marinoid waters, and there murder us!
Returning here, he would tell Nona we
were safe in Rax, and hold her to her
promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was thus, doubtless, the crafty Og was
planning. He wanted Nona’s promise—and
yet certainly he would not want us
three men back in Rax, with our knowledge
of the Maagog plans, and of the coming
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Nona herself suggested a possible
way out of our desperate situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall tell Og,” she cried, “that we
cannot be sure he will live up to his promise.
If he returns you to Rax, I will agree
to be his queen. His smiling queen.” She
shuddered, and her body pressed against
mine. “I shall tell him that. And, Nemo,
do you not understand? I shall tell him
he must take me also to the Marinoid entrance
so that I may see you three swim
safely into Marinoid waters. He will do
that, no doubt. And there—at the last
moment—you will fight—we will all
fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her white face turned to me; her beautiful
lips were pressed grimly together.
“Fight, my Nemo! Then we shall escape—if
we can surprise him. Or at least
we shall all die together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To such a desperate plan our despair
forced us. It seemed the only way. We
discussed it—for how long I cannot say.
And then, abruptly we saw Og again in
the tunnel-mouth. The black fishes were
swarming about him—fawning upon him
with their grewsome whines of pleasure.
He stopped to stroke one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have decided?” he said to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Atar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fear seemed to have dropped from our
young prince. For the first time since we
left Rax, he dominated Caan and me. He
stood now fronting Og unflinching—his
face white and set, his eyes smouldering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his lips were smiling. “We do not
desire death,” he said. “We will return
to Rax, and she will give the promise
you ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to Nona, signing her to
speak. “You will trust him to send us
safely to Rax?” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” cried Nona. And she added,
with a flow of woman’s words, the proposal
we had planned—her insistence that
she be taken along to see us safely into
Marinoid waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og listened silently. Then he gazed
from one to the other of us. The crafty
smile on his face made my heart sink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think perhaps to escape with her
on the journey?” he suggested. And when
we did not answer, his arm waved away
the idea. “I shall take care that you do
not.” Then to Nona: “You speak well,
my queen. For your promise I will do
much. You shall go.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Again he was silent, pondering. I
could almost see some new murderous
scheme taking form in his brain. He
added suddenly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, you shall go, Queen of the
Maagogs, if that is your wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned toward the tunnel mouth. The
black fishes were crowded there, staring at
us. Og’s sardonic laugh rang out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience, little black ones. You will go
with us, of course. You will go to see
that my queen does not escape me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swung back to Atar, and said curtly:
“During the next sleep time we will start.
The Maagogs—some of them—think I
ought to kill you now—not send you back
to Rax. We will leave while they are
asleep—to avoid trouble. I shall come for
you then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed ironically to Nona, swam to
the tunnel-mouth, and with a parting admonition
to the fishes gathered there, he
disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again we were alone. Our plans already
had miscarried. We realized it. As
though our thoughts had been written on
our faces, Og had understood our purpose.
There would be no chance for us to escape
with Nona. The black fishes were going
with us. And during that coming journey,
we knew Og intended to kill us men—kill
us and still make Nona think we were
safe—hold her to her promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed. The warm water of the
cave oppressed us—yet we were all cold
with fear and despair. The very silence
of the room seemed sinister—that tense silence
that urges one to scream. We were
not talking now—we were thinking—planning
a thousand desperate, impractical
plans, all of which seemed to mean nothing
but death for us men, and worse than
death for Nona. It must be now the Time
of Sleep .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Og would be back soon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I held my Nona close—waiting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the tunnel a dim human figure appeared,
taking shape out of the distant
blackness of the passageway. It was swimming
swiftly but silently toward us.
Through the moving ranks of the black
fishes circling there, it threaded its way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not Og! And then we saw
it was a woman—a Maagog woman—Maaret,
the girl!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona was nearest to the tunnel. I flung
myself forward to protect her. But just
inside our cave Maaret stopped. Her furtive
glance swept the tunnel behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she turned to me. And her gesture
warned us all to be silent!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Maaret’s voice when she spoke
was low, cautious. We listened
to her swift words, our hearts
pounding with sudden hope. She said
she had come to save us! Her motive was
clear, we already understood it. Yet she
told us it, briefly, and with a direct simplicity
that carried the conviction of truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since Og had returned from living in
Rax (after his combat with me) Maaret
had belonged to him. She loved him.
Then had come this woman Nona. Maaret’s
gaze swept my poor innocent Nona
with hatred. This woman Nona, she said,
had (with her strange, uncanny looks which
Og thought were beauty) won Og from
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In brief, Maaret wished only that we
all—with Nona—return to Rax. Then perhaps
she could make Og love her again.
Our escape, taking Nona with us, was all
she desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or the death of all of us,” Caan suggested.
And his look to me was significant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maaret gestured vehemently. “That, of
course,” she admitted frankly. “The black
fishes I would set upon you now. But
your screams would bring Og. You would
not die. I should lose him by that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed indeed sincere. She said
she could command the black fishes. She
would take them away—lock them up. And
then we could escape. But we must hurry.
It was already the Time of Sleep. At any
moment Og would be here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We consulted; Maaret swam to the
mouth of the passageway and gazed anxiously
into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we trust her?” Caan demanded.
“Will she not let us start, perhaps, and
then set the black fishes upon us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was possible; and yet we had to trust
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar called her back. “Which way do
we go? We will get lost, girl. Will you
go with us, until we get to open water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would not. If Og knew what she
had done he would kill her. But we could
easily find our way. This tunnel led into
the main cave. Everyone there would be
asleep at this hour. We could slip unnoticed
across the cave, up to that ledge and
into that other tunnel which was familiar
to us. From there we knew our way—through
the shallow coral barrier, and up
into the open Water of Wild Things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A monster may be there at the tunnel
entrance,” I suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She admitted it, but of that we had to
take our chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girl speaks truth,” Atar said suddenly.
“I like her. I believe her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maaret’s smile answered him, but her
worried gaze was still on the passageway by
which at any moment now Og might arrive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must go,” agreed Nona. And then
she startled us all. She swam to Maaret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are good,” she said. “I would not
harm you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maaret shrank away. “You take
my Og.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not want your Og.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were all so relieved at the turn affairs
had taken that we found ourselves
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is your friend, Maaret,” I said. “She
loves me—she is my woman—and Boy is
our son. She does not want your Og. She
wants only to get back to Rax with me.
She wants never to see Og again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl nodded, only half convinced.
Indeed, I suppose her attitude toward Nona
was only natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” Maaret urged. “At any moment
it will be too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We followed her reluctantly. At our approach
the black fishes surged upon us. But
Maaret held them in check. They obeyed
her low-toned but stern commands. Yet
they seemed to sense that something was
wrong. Two or three of them dashed at
me threateningly. Their low rumbling
voices were like the snarls of an enraged
dog. In panic, I kicked at them. Then
Maaret’s command called them off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were all in the passageway, in the
very midst of the fishes. A side doorway
was there—a doorway into a large cage of
water. The doorway was barred by a
grating. Maaret removed it and began
herding the fishes into the cage. They were
all in but the last three or four, when
abruptly we heard Og’s voice from out of
the dimness along the passageway! His
voice—shouting with surprise and anger.
And his figure appeared, plunging at us!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Caan shouted an admonition which
none of us heeded. Atar dove for
Og. I was vaguely aware that Maaret with
presence of mind had jammed back the
grating into place, locking all but three
of the fishes in the cage. I heard her
low cry of dismay. Og seemed not to have
seen her, and she sank into a shadow by
the wall—out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Nona’s voice urged me forward.
Og and Atar were grappling with each
other. Og rasped out an order; and the
three black fishes rushed for Caan and
me. I struck at one, to keep it away
from Nona. The needle teeth of another
sank into my leg, and clung. With my
bare hands I reached down and gripped the
thing by the body. Its black skin was
slimy; its teeth in the flesh of my calf
were like fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan, Atar and Og were shouting. The
noise would bring help for Og!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet!” I called. I tried to lunge
forward with that thing still clinging to
my leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar and Caan fell silent. But Og’s
voice rose higher than ever. I did not
know exactly what was going on; the water
over there was in a turmoil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona was beside me. Her fingers were
feeling of the black fish, trying to help me
tear it loose. Then I found its jaws;
pulled them apart. It lunged away from
me. I swung up into the water and looked
about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar and Og were still fighting. Caan
had shocked two of the fishes into insensibility.
Old as he was, he still possessed
sufficient power to stun them. The third
fish—the one I had repulsed—made for
him. I left Nona and dove forward toward
Og and Atar. They were circling each
other, both trying to get into position to
give the electric shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, from out of the shadows beside
them, a figure appeared, lurking there silently.
Maaret! I had forgotten her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og suddenly gripped Atar by the ankles.
I saw that he had Atar almost in the fatal
position to receive the shock. But I was
too far away to stop it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I called a warning. But Atar seemed
confused. And then I saw Maaret slide
silently forward. She kept behind Og,
where he could not see her. In her hand
she held something white—a heavy shell,
or something of the kind. It swung through
the water, struck Og on the head. He relaxed
from Atar; his unconscious body sank
to the floor of the passageway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan had by now disposed of the other
fish. Atar joined us, panting from his
exertions. We were all free to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come!” exclaimed Caan. “The cave
will be aroused! We must hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maaret was crouching over Og’s stunned
body. Her arms were around him; she
was crying softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go!” she said angrily. And ignoring
us, she fell to caressing Og. Frightened
at what she had done, she was begging him
to open his eyes—speak to her—tell her
he was not badly hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We hastened away. It was not far to
the cave. We dashed into it, recklessly.
It was more dimly lighted than when we
had last seen it. The main floor was
empty. There were family groups in most
of the wall niches. Many of them were
still asleep. Others, awakened, were looking
sleepily about for the cause of the distant
disturbance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We dashed without pause up into the
cave. The familiar ledge and tunnel-mouth
were easy to locate. The Maagogs saw us.
An uproar arose. But before any concerted
effort to stop us could be made, we
were up across the cave, over the ledge
and into the tunnel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe!” exclaimed Atar. “Hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were shouts behind us. But—without
Og and the black fishes—we did not
fear any of the Maagogs who might try
and follow us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were soon through the coral barrier.
Another few moments and we were at the
main tunnel-mouth. The open Water of
Wild Things stretched above us. For a
moment we hesitated, looking cautiously up
there. But no monsters were in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon we will be in Rax,” I murmured
exultantly to Nona. And her loving arms
went around me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan was looking back down the passageway.
“Nemo, you hear that?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Our blood ran cold. In the distance,
back toward the cave, we could hear
those horrible yelping cries! Og had recovered!
He had let loose the black fishes
upon our trail! They could outswim us.
We could not hide from them. And this
time when they caught us, Og would not
call them off!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to do but try and
get across the Water of Wild Things before
we were overtaken. The way before
us was open. Every second we hesitated
made our chances less.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We plunged up into the black void.
Swimming in couples, Nona and I followed
Caan and Atar. They led us close along
the sea-bottom. Coming in, Caan had been
careful to remark the lay of the bottom
so that he could find his way back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We swam fast, too fast for talking save
an occasional monosyllable. Behind us we
could hear the cries of our pursuers. Growing
louder, steadily, but slowly. It was a
stern chase, and if we could hold our present
speed—a long chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On we swept, just above the sea-bottom.
Occasionally giant crabs would scuttle away
from us, alarmed by our swift movement.
To the sides, lights sometimes showed—the
lighted heads of monsters. But none
came near us. A thing all spines drifted
past; but it did not molest us. A giant
clam, larger far than any one of us, was
lying on the sea-bottom in our path. It
opened its shells as though hungrily to suck
us in, but we avoided it. We came at
last to the side wall of the black void of
water—the wall alongside of which we had
descended. Up there, a few thousand feet,
lay the entrance to the Marinoid domain.
If we could get into that entrance—into
the coral forest before the black fishes
caught us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We swam upward, along the line of
wall, a few hundred feet off. Directly beneath
us now, following every twist of our
trail, the pursuing fishes were yelping. They
were much closer. And Nona was tiring!
It was the longest, most sustained fast
swimming she or I had ever attempted.
Atar and Caan were drawing away from
us. They did not realize it, and I did not
call to them. Perhaps, if we two gave out,
they could go on and save themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Caan looked back. They slackened
their pace and we caught up with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go—on,” I panted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they would not go faster than we
could go. And we all knew that very soon
now we would be caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were perhaps two thirds the way up
the wall when suddenly Caan and Atar
swung sharply out to one side. Nona
and I followed, as one fish follows the
turns and twists of another. I looked to
see what was wrong. Overhead, directly
in our former path, loomed the black, unlighted
bulk of a giant monster, huge and
fearsome beyond anything we had ever
before encountered!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We had no time to decide what
we should do. The monster
saw us. Beneath us—almost in
sight now—the black fishes were mounting.
And further below them—dim and
muffled in the distance—we heard Og’s
voice shouting a shrill command to urge
them on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We darted out sidewise, away from the
wall. Atar was leading, and single-file, we
others followed. Then Atar turned suddenly
and doubled back upon himself.
Strung out in a line, we turned with him.
Making straight for the jagged cliff-face,
we passed close under the monster, between
it and the mounting black fishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The monster was slow, ponderous in its
movements. It was coming down, and as
we darted under it I stared up and saw it
plainly. A gigantic black thing. A spherical
head, twenty feet broad; a thick, elongated
body—a hundred feet or more in
length. There were no fins, and no tail.
The head had two great protruding eyes,
gleaming green, and beneath them a circular
mouth—a mouth which even undistended
was large enough to suck in our
bodies. And around the head, fastened to
it—framing the face—were a dozen arms!
They were waving tentacles with a sucker
disk at the end of some, and a hook at
the end of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A squid! you perhaps explain. It was,
indeed, fashioned somewhat after the plan
of the squid of your earthly waters. Let
me call it then, a squid. It came down
ponderously, waving its tentacles and floundering
with its unwieldy body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Avoiding it, we struck the cliff-face. A
depression was there—a sort of ledge. On
it we huddled, panting; Nona and I were
almost exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must go on!” Caan whispered.
“The black fishes—they will find us. And
that giant thing—it can suck us up—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Atar silenced him. Atar knew what
he was doing. And most of all, this momentary
inactivity was allowing Nona and
me to rest. We could not have gone much
further in any event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant squid had swung awkwardly
to follow us. Then evidently it heard the
yelps of the uprushing fishes. It hesitated,
turned downward; it was below us, and
out from the wall, but still in plain sight;
and we saw the black fishes sweep up to
attack it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On every side the monster was assailed.
There must have been two hundred or more
of those ugly, squat little things. The
bulk of the squid dwarfed them into insignificance;
but like bull terriers worrying
a prostrate elephant, they tore at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The squid floundered. Its lashing tentacles
hooked the fishes and flung them
away. Its mouth sucked them in and swallowed
them. But scores of the fishes
gripped the tentacles and clung; others bit
and tore at the soft, puffy flesh; still others
swarmed at the monster’s protruding
eyes, gouging them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The squid was in distress. It pulled
itself to the wall below us and clung with
its suckers. Then it let go, and ejecting
a great stream of water from its mouth,
forced itself swiftly backward. But the
swarm of fishes still tore at it. One of its
eyes went out. Its lacerated flesh gave a
stench to the water that sickened us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan was plucking at me. “We must
go—now while we have the chance. Og
may call his fishes—set them on us—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where was Og? I had forgotten him.
He had fled, doubtless. Then we heard
his voice. He was hovering off in the open
water; we heard him screaming angrily
to the fishes, trying to call them off the
squid—to set them again on our trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We started upward, close to the cliff-face.
Og would not see us perhaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faster!” urged Caan. “We swim like
children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar again led us in single file. I was
last, swimming just after Nona. I turned
to look downward. The squid was lashing
the water in desperate fury. The fishes,
many of them, were floating downward—inert.
But many others, ignoring Og’s
commands in their lust for blood, were still
attacking. I saw Og now, well off to one
side. A dozen or so of the fishes were
gathered around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water down there by the squid
was lashed white. It caught what light
there was and I could see everything
plainly. Then, as the squid rolled over
with a last despairing effort, I saw a great
stream of inky black fluid issue from it.
The ink spread. Everything turned to
blackness. The squid, as a last desperate
measure, had emptied its inkbag and under
cover of the darkness was trying to escape.
The water down there was a bowl of
ink, out of which came the snarls of the
fishes, and Og’s shrill voice shouting
commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We mounted swiftly, for Nona and I were
refreshed by our brief rest. Soon we were
within sight of the horizontal slit in the
cliff—the entrance to home! But again beneath
us, we heard Og’s shouts and the
deep-throated cries. They were after us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar, leading us, abruptly stopped. My
heart leaped to my throat. Was it another
monster ahead? It was something. There
was something sweeping toward us! Not
slowly, ponderously this time—but swift
almost as a thrown spear! From up near
the horizontal passage we saw it coming—small,
a dim blob at first, with a little
V-shaped white wake behind it. Larger,
closer—a few seconds only, while we huddled
together, wholly confused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning in an arc, this new thing swept
at us—slowed down its flight, and stopped
beside us. We shouted with the relief of
hysteria. It was our Marinoid King—Atar’s
father—alone in his sleigh, driving his dolphin-like
animal which could pull it faster
than any of us could swim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were safe!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Into the sleigh we climbed. Nona sat
in the seat beside the king. Og and his
black fishes were approaching; but we were
away, gliding through the water with a
speed that soon outdistanced them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sleigh itself was constructed to be
slightly heavier than water, so that it could
glide along the sea-bottom. But now it was
buoyed by tiny air-pods fastened to it, so
that of itself it would neither float nor
sink. We started away after no more than
the briefest of greetings with our king. We
three men clung to the rim of the sleigh
behind. Its rapid motion threw our bodies
out horizontally, like men clinging to the
tail of a speeding airplane in the rush of air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never before had I moved through water
so fast. It roared in my ears, blurred my
sight, and choked me. Dimly I saw the
passageway speeding past beside us. We
were paralleling it; not entering, but heading
for its further end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we seemed to go still faster. I
coughed, choked. The press of water against
my mouth stifled my breathing. My lungs
were full and I could not exhale. I heard
Atar’s voice—a shout: “Nemo—your arm—put
it—before your face! You—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rushing water tore away his words.
But I understood. I clung with my right
hand to the sleigh; with my left arm crooked
before my face, in the back-eddy of water
behind it, I breathed again. And then I saw
that all the others were doing the same.
Had I not done it, I should have been
drowned—as <span class='it'>you</span> perhaps have choked a
fish to death by towing it rapidly through
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We dashed onward, with the water roaring
past. Then in a gentle arc we swung
to the left and slackened to normal swimming
speed. A mud-ooze floor was close
under us; a ceiling came down overhead.
We were in the slit, headed for the coral
forest. The coral barrier! I gasped as I
thought of it. How had the King come
through that barrier with his sleigh?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was now crouching, clinging to the
sleigh at Nona’s side. I asked the question,
but no one heard me. They were all talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King had an arm about my Nona,
paternally, affectionately. “I am glad you
are safely returned, my child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar was asking: “My father—what made
you come for us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King answered very gravely: “Your
mother—she was worried, Atar.” His eyes
were laughing. “I had to slip away, unseen
in the Time of Sleep. Our people would
not like their monarch dashing off alone to
possible danger. But though I am an old
man, there is lust for fighting in me yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I made my question heard. The
King sobered instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much is coming to pass in Rax—strange
things I learn every hour—and all of danger
to us and our people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told us then that upon the heels of
our own departure into the Water of Wild
Things (it had been two eating times before,
as I well knew by the hunger which
possessed me) the Marinoid guards had
noticed an open swathe cut through the
coral forest. They found it, and reported it
to the King—a thirty-foot-wide lane. Evidently
it had been recently done by the
Maagogs. In our own hasty search for an
entrance, we three had overlooked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King, hearing that, had decided to
drive a short distance in to the Water of
Wild Things and look for our return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, our sleigh reached the coral
forest. We passed along it a short distance,
and arrived at a grating thirty feet square.
The situation was now plain to us, and
hastily we told the King what we had
learned from the Maagogs. Og, sure of the
coming war and his own leadership, was
preparing to strike at once. He had this
lane cut through the coral to give free
passage to his Maagog army in its attack on
Rax. This grating Og had put there to keep
the monsters from wandering into Marinoid
waters. He was going to conquer those
waters—and he wanted no monsters there
to harass the future of the victorious
Maagogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grating was easily removable. The
King had swung it aside to get his sleigh
past; and we swung it now, to return. Soon
we were speeding out across the cool, sweet
Marinoid waters. They were dim with twilight.
Peaceful, beautiful, a Garden of Paradise
to us, returning now from that foul
Water of Wild Things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was still the Time of Sleep in Rax
when we arrived. Quietly, unobtrusively, we
slipped unnoticed into the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Nona was again with Boy! The joy
of it! I am a mere man; I cannot describe—I
know I cannot even appreciate—how my
Nona felt to hold Boy again to her breast;
to feel his baby arms about her neck; to
hear his gleeful, welcoming cries. Only a
mother can understand; and I, a man, could
but stand and watch, and wonder.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Those next three days in Rax—the
three days immediately following our
return from the Water of Wild
Things—were critical. We did, indeed, have
but little time for sleep. We were exhausted
when we returned—Nona and I. We played
with Boy a little; and then, with him beside
us lustily practicing his newly learned swimming
strokes, we fell into deep slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar awakened us. The city, he said, was
seething with excitement. Our return was
already known. Rumor of danger—nobody
knew just what—was on every tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar was pale, but composed. “Strange
things are impending, Nemo. Very strange.
And ominous—frightening. My father bids
me bring you to him now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said it so ceremoniously, so solemnly,
that his tone alarmed me more than the
words. I sat him down and he waited
impatiently while Nona hastily prepared us
food. Then—with Nona and Boy—we swam
past Caan’s house. Nona and Boy stayed
there; I would not again leave them alone.
Then Atar and I went on, swimming slowly
through the city streets toward the King’s
palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city was indeed in turmoil. I wondered
how the news of our return had
spread so swiftly. To do anything secretly
of public interest and importance is difficult.
And yet how should the Marinoids know
already that danger was all about us in the
water? How could they know that war with
the Maagogs was impending? The city
knew it; rumor of it was everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The streets had almost a holiday aspect.
At every intersection groups of swimmers
were gathered. Passersby were hurrying to
and fro, aimlessly. Women cluttered the balconies.
A holiday aspect, did I say? It was
not that. The crowds hung poised, talking
in low tones; the swimmers gazed often
behind them apprehensively; the women on
the balconies stared down with solemn,
frightened eyes—and hushed their children
with over-stern commands. Terror, not joy,
was in the water that morning—a nameless
terror, born of the Unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I whispered something of the kind to
Atar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon they will know what the danger
is,” he answered. “Then will come enthusiasm,
the desire to fight. The terror will be
forgotten. Father’s speech to them will fix
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said. “We must give them that,
or we are lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we swam forward through the streets,
the people recognized us. Occasionally a few
would cheer; but for the most part they
stared at us silently. Some followed us; soon
there would have been a crowd in line
behind us, but Atar dispersed them imperiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Atar! Look there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a doorway a figure was lurking. A
man. I recognized him. He had never
married; and I remembered that they said
no Marinoid girl would take him for mate
because of his Maagog origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The half-breeds! I have so far mentioned
them but casually. With both Marinoid and
Maagog blood, they were called Marinogs—a
term they resented heartily. I had never
given them much thought, had never known
nor cared how many of them there might
be. But now, as you shall hear, we were
soon to deal with them in tragic fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marinog in the doorway stood motionless.
And as we passed, I felt his inscrutable
gaze upon us. Something in it
made me shiver, and I turned and looked
back to him. He was still staring—his face
wholly expressionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar pulled me on. As we approached
the King’s palace, the throngs in the streets
grew denser. They cheered us more frequently
now. But among them, everywhere,
I saw Marinogs—whiter, puffy of flesh, with
larger eyes. Those were the real half-breeds.
But I wondered how many there might prove
to be among us with that unseen, unmarked
taint of Maagog blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowds cheered—but the Marinogs
were silent. They swam about furtively; or
lurked in doorways; or in tangles of the
street vegetation here and there. And always
I felt their stolid gaze upon Atar and me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered the upper palace doorway, at
the threshold of which the dolphin sleigh
lay waiting on the platform. In a broad low
room, brightly lighted by rows of pods at
its ceiling, the King greeted us. He was
seated in a shell, on a throne built of smaller
shells cemented together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Save for him, the apartment was empty.
He kept his seat, and we reclined on the
platform at his feet. Outside we could hear
the murmurs of the gathering crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must speak to them soon, my
father,” said Atar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King nodded. He was very grave,
perturbed inwardly I knew; but outwardly
solemn and grim. Then, suddenly discarding
his reserve, he talked to me as though I
were his son. For generations, he said, this
secret mingling of Marinoid and Maagog
blood had been a source of concern to the
Government at Rax. There were no more
than a few hundred known half-breeds in
each of the Marinoid cities. The Marinoid
women were averse to mating with them.
Yet, nevertheless, thousands perhaps of the
Marinoids were tainted. There were two
reasons for this. First: Some of the Maagog
men who had smuggled themselves in,
looked enough like Marinoids to pass unrecognized.
And secondly: There were immoral
Marinoid women in all the cities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there may be several thousand of
these Marinogs—these half-breeds,” I exclaimed.
“But why should they all turn
against us?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Prophetic thought! we did not
know then that the Marinogs <span class='it'>would</span>
turn against us. And yet we feared it. They
were looked down upon—scorned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though we did not know it then, our
fears were all too well founded. Og had
already sent emissaries from the Water of
Wild Things. One by one they had smuggled
themselves through the coral barrier
and into the Marinoid cities. It was they
who were spreading the rumors of coming
war. Their insidious talk was inciting the
half-breeds. They were telling the half-breeds
that this was the beginning of a new
era. The Maagogs soon would rule in Rax.
The despised half-breeds then would take
their place as rightful, honored leaders.
The Marinoid women—those beautiful
women who always had scorned them—would
be their slaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King long had feared such conditions
as these which now were coming to
pass; and he told his fears to me frankly.
Then he smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have thought me unprepared,
Nemo,” he added. “I am—for this sudden
crisis—and yet not wholly so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he told me that for most of his
reign—all Atar’s life, in fact—he had maintained
a secret cavern in Marinoid waters,
where preparations for war were going forward.
I had not known that. Caan even
now did not know it. The strictest secrecy
was maintained, for above everything the
half-breeds and Maagogs had to be kept in
ignorance of it. The cavern was not far
from Rax. It was well guarded; and no
one had ever been in it, or heard of it,
save a few of those known to be of full
and loyal Marinoid blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not wholly unprepared, Nemo,” the
King repeated. “After the next Time of
Sleep I will take you to the cavern. If this
Og will only delay a little—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A noise outside the palace interrupted
him. For some moments I had been conscious
of a growing murmur, a confusion;
which now broke out into cheers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King swam from his seat and we
followed him across the room. Through a
doorway upward, we emerged to the palace
roof-top. It was empty, but in the foliage
overhead figures were clinging; and I saw
that the whole open cube of water before
the palace was cluttered with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shaded lights along the parapet were
lighted, flinging their greenish beams outward
and leaving the roof in shadow. A
great cheer rolled out as we appeared. The
King advanced to the parapet; and at his
low-toned command, Atar turned several of
the lights to shine full upon him. He
stood there facing the throng; his figure,
thrown into bold relief by the light upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheering continued. Figures fluttered
overhead, seeking places of vantage. Then
silence fell; and extending his four arms
outward to his people, the King spoke.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Atar and I crouched in the shadows
at the King’s feet; but between two
of the illuminated pods, I could see plainly
the green-glowing water before us, with its
silent, expectant throng of faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King spoke slowly, carefully at first.
Gradually his voice rose in power; the
smile faded from his face. With grim,
forceful words, he told of the Maagog peril—bid
all his loyal subjects hold themselves
ready for his commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A burst of cheering interrupted him. The
crowd waved its arms; in the confusion
many of the spectators overhead lost their
holds, or were crowded from their places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then again silence fell over the water.
And in the silence a single voice shouted
two words. A female voice—the shrill voice
of some Marinoid girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loyal subjects!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She called it out cynically, quoting it
from the King’s last sentence. She was
directly across the water from me; I saw
her plainly—a girl who was considered one
of the beauties of Rax. A half-breed man
was passing near her, and obviously she was
aiming the taunt at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loyal subjects!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she added: “That does not
mean <span class='it'>you</span>—Marinog!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It roused the half-breed to frenzy. He
dashed at the girl, struck her in the breast
with his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly there was confusion. A dozen
swimming figures cut off my view. Out of
the melee the Marinog came diving. I saw
him escape in the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King was trying to cover up the
incident by going on with his speech. But
they would not listen to him. From everywhere
came shouts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down with the Marinogs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half-breeds! Tainted blood of the
Maagogs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King’s speech had precipitated the
very thing he had been trying to avoid! In
a sudden fervor of patriotism against the
Maagogs, the people were openly taunting
all of Maagog blood among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were many half-breeds in the crowd—lurking
in secluded spots, eying the King
with their huge, solemn eyes. They began
slinking away; and most of the crowd let
them go. Except the Marinoid girls. Perversely
feminine, the girls swam around
them—taunting, laughing, jeering.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The King looked down anxiously at
Atar and me. Then, with sudden dominance,
his roaring voice stilled the confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence all! Your King speaks! Are
you Maagogs that you defy the majesty of
your King? You are unjust to the half-breeds.
The half-breeds are loyal. Their
Maagog blood is forgotten. Tainted they
were by heritage—but their taint is washed
clean by our Marinoid Waters. They are
your brothers! You must love them! They
are loyal to me! I trust them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loyal!” the King repeated. “And when
the war is over and we have defeated our
foul enemies from the Water of Wild
Things—the loyal half-breeds will be honored
among us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crowd is easily swayed for the moment.
Soon they were cheering the half-breeds—exhorting
them to remain loyal. The girl
whose taunting words had started the trouble
was swimming toward us across the
open cube of water. Some instinct at that
moment caused me to glance overhead. A
figure was clinging to the foliage directly
above the King—a half-breed man. I saw
his arms fling something downward. Something
long and thin, and gleaming green-white
in the glare of lights. It looked like
a spear. But it came down more slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I saw it was swimming! A
needle-fish the length of a man, with a nose
two feet long, pointed and stiff as a rapier!
With increasing speed it was swimming
downward directly at the King!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second or two of confused thought too
rapid for action. The needle-fish was darting
downward faster now than a thrown spear.
The King was unaware of it. The fish’s
rapier nose would run him through from
back to chest!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found myself gripping the King’s legs,
trying to pull him down. But another figure
from near at hand dove at him. The Marinoid
girl who had taunted the half-breed!
Her arms went around the King’s neck.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
A flash of silver as the needle-fish came at
them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A choking female cry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
girl’s body sank to the roof-top at the feet
of the startled King. On her face, inert,
she lay with the fish like a sword-blade
buried in her back!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King was unhurt. He was shouting
commands at the excited crowd. Overhead
there was a scuffle—a scream of anguish;
the half-breed’s body—he who had launched
the needle-fish—came slowly down to us.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I saw a dozen spears from the enraged
crowd sticking in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We lifted up the girl—grotesque to my
mind with her four arms—but by Marinoid
standards one of their greatest beauties. She
was still alive. Thoughtlessly, I pulled the
fish from her wound, broke its sword-blade
nose across my knee—snapped its slim body
as one would snap a length of string.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thoughtless act! From the wound the
girl’s blood gushed. It spread like smoke in
air; the water all around us was pink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar had his arms about the girl. Then
he got to his feet; and with a command
to the crowd to disperse, he swam away to
fetch the man of medicine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King and I knelt by the girl. Atar
would be too late; she was dying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child,” said the King gently, “soon you
will be healed and strong again. And never
shall I forget what you did for me today.”
But she shook her head weakly; her lips,
twisted with pain, were trying to smile at
him. Her words were low, halting; the
King and I bent lower to hear them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loyal—subjects! <span class='it'>I</span> was loyal. Didn’t—mean
to start—any trouble. You—forgive
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the King. “Don’t talk now,
child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loyal,” she repeated. “Everyone should
be—loyal to his King. I’m—glad I could
show— To die for—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood gushing from her mouth
stopped the words; but her eyes were still
smiling—smiling as they glazed and the
light faded from them.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Nona,” I said, “do you wish to
go to this merry-making? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Caan, should I take her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was two days after the attempted assassination
of the King. I had not yet seen
the cavern where the King was preparing
for war. I was going there after this next
time of sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We in Rax—the King, Atar, Caan and
I—were much perturbed at the turn affairs
were taking We knew now that Og’s
emissaries were among us. But they kept
themselves hidden—talking secretly to the
half-breeds, to all who sympathized with
the Maagogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We knew all this; but we could do
nothing about it. There was no police
force, or army, or anything of the kind
in this crude Marinoid civilization. Soon
the King would organize an army—we were
planning to do that almost at once—as
soon as the final preparations in the cavern
were complete. And meanwhile the King
wished to do nothing that might precipitate
further trouble with the half-breeds. An
internal revolt, on the ere of foreign warfare—that
was what we most dreaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this juncture that some of the
King’s councillors suggested a public celebration,
such as was always held at the
birth of a child to the royal family, or on
other festive national occasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A celebration! When we were at the
brink of war! To me, it was a mistake. It
could do nothing but humiliate—antagonize—the
half-breeds. They could not take
open part in it; the Marinoids would not
permit that. Yet, said the King, we had
our own people to think of. There is a
certain human quality of mind which turns
to merry-making on the eve of danger. You
on Earth have seen that in your own
history. The Marinoid morale would be
helped. To laugh, sing, shout, and make
love—and then go to battle. That was
what the people wished; and against my
advice, the celebration was to be held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in Caan’s house—where Boy was
asleep with Caan’s children—we were planning
to go to the cube of water before the
palace where the festival was to be held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take me,” cried Nona. “I want to go
with you, my Nemo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never had my Nona seen public merry-making;
the woman in her was very eager
to go, to take part in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I took her. With Caan, we started
after that next meal; and Caan’s woman
stayed at home with Boy and her own
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My last moment decision to take Nona
seemed somewhat superfluous, for all that
day she had been getting ready to go!
Clothes! My Nona was as interested in
them as any woman of your own Earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had made every preparation, and
soon she swam before us, laughing with
excitement and delight. I gasped. For the
first time, I saw her usually up-flowing
hair bound down to her shapely head,
coiled and braided, and with a garland of
tiny marine flowers in it. A new, close-fitting
suit, with a girdle. And anklets
of dull green, which by contrast made her
smooth skin shine like polished pink marble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like me, my Nemo?” she laughed.
And she eyed me sidewise through lowered
lashes—as though I were not her mate, but
only one who wished to be.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Then we started. The streets—more
brightly lighted than usual—were bedecked
with flowers. The light slanting
down through the water from overhead lent
queer grotesque shadows to the figures swimming
beneath them. The crowd was all
moving toward the palace. Marinoid men
and girls—gaudily dressed; the girls, I
noticed, all more scantily robed than upon
less festive occasions. In couples and little
groups, they swam along. The water rang
with the gay voices of the girls. A cart
passed us—a sleigh driven by a swimming
animal—the equipage of one of the King’s
advisers. But its owner was not in it now.
It was loaded with Marinoid girls; as they
swept past, one of them leaned out and
tossed a garland of seaweed over my head,
laughing at me provocatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We three—Caan, Nona and I—swam
slowly onward. The eve of warfare! No
one would have believed it who swam the
gay streets of Rax that night! And yet—a
figure lurked here and there. The Marinog
half breeds! From doorways of houses
dark, with the shades all closed, from rooftops,
tangles of street vegetation, they
hovered, motionless. Or swam furtively,
close along the walls of cross-streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could feel their eyes upon me. At one
corner we passed a giant half-breed man.
He stood on the street-bottom, motionless,
and he did not move to make way for us.
I passed quite close to him; and I could
sense that his figure stiffened, tensed. I
looked back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was staring after me,
grim, inscrutable, sinister.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The palace, and the water before it, were
jammed. Glaring green water. Lights
everywhere. Crowds of gaudy figures.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Laughing girls, alert to their sex.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Confusion
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gaiety everywhere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I followed Caan, keeping Nona close beside
me. On the palace roof we came to
rest, near a sort of throne erected at the
parapet—a throne on which the King and
Queen were sitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar joined us. “Will you eat now?
Food is there waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled at my Nona, kneeling before
her. And she bent down and touched his
head with her cheek, Marinoid fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did not care to eat; across the palace
roof I could see servants of the King handing
out food to all who approached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the edge of the parapet, with the
King and Queen above us, and Atar gallantly
at Nona’s side, we sat down to watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was music in the water! I looked
about for its source. At first I did not
know what it was; how should I—since I
had never heard music before? It came
from a platform that dangled from the
foliage overhead. On the platform were a
dozen Marinoid men. Three or four plucked
at thin, vibrating lengths of fish-bone, which
gave off curiously twanging, but not unmusical
notes. The rest pounded shells of
different sizes—thumped them with resilient
little hammers in odd rhythm.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>An orchestra! Perhaps you could
call it that. They played it with
enthusiasm, and almost continuously. On
the platform also were three Marinoid girls.
One of them, waving a long, filmy robe
about her, was twisting her body in the
music’s rhythm; when she tired, the other
girls took her place. And their voices, singing,
joined the music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona and I watched, breathless, confused,
but like children at your circus, eager to
see everything which simultaneously was
going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, several young men swam to
different parts of the arena, and clung to
the foliage. A young girl—one of the
Marinoid beauties—swam to the center of
the open water. She hung poised; and as
the music suddenly stopped, she unbound
her coiled hair and dropped the garland
of seaweed which had been adorning it.
The garland drifted downward. The girl
uttered a sudden sharp command. At the
signal, the young men dove for the prize.
A sharp scuffle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then one, quicker,
more fortunate than the rest, secured the
garland and amid applause from the onlookers,
swam up and restored it to the
girl. Her embrace thanked him. With
tenderly lingering fingers he bound up her
tresses and adorned them with the garland;
and together they swam off to the roof-top
to eat, or to sit down and watch the performance
repeated by others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another section of the water, the
couples thus chosen were dancing. I can
call it nothing else—swimming in close
embrace in time to the music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there were other games, the details
of which I could not grasp. Combats between
young men—bloodless, but real
enough for all that—with the maiden’s
favor always as the prize. Nona and I sat
enthralled. I was disappointed in my Nona.
She wanted to join in the games! But I
would not let her, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were getting hungry. I turned to
find that Atar was no longer with us. On
the throne behind us the King was adorning
a Marinoid girl just chosen as the most
beautiful. But where was Atar?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A group of girls and a gay young man
came swimming up and importuned the
King. He listened to them, and then
signed for Nona and me to approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo,” he said. “They wish your Nona
for the swimming and diving exhibitions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not know what he meant at once;
but Nona seemed to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo! Let me do it! Please!” Her
eagerness was child-like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then abruptly Atar dashed up. He
whispered to the King. Then he turned
to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo, come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona was still begging me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let her do it,” said Atar. “We will be
back shortly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will stay near her?” I said to Caan.
I could not leave Nona again uncared for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caan nodded; and Atar pulled me away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We swam from the gay, noisy scene—up
a dim cross-street which was silent and
deserted. Atar had not spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” I demanded.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“The half-breeds!” He increased his
pace. Soon we were at the roof of
the city; open water stretched above us.
From the cross-streets at the side of the city,
figures were issuing—the figures of men,
women and children. They came out into
the open water furtively, and mounted at
once. Little groups, mounting upward to
gather in a crowd above the city. And then
streaming off in a line single-file—a swimming
line of figures which already extended
out of sight into the dimness of the distant
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The half-breeds—Marinogs—all the Maagog
sympathizers—were leaving Rax! Rats
leaving a sinking ship? Was it that? Or
a gathering for action somewhere else? The
Water of Wild Things lay in that direction.
Were they going there? Or to Gahna—sister
city to Rax? Gahna also lay that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We watched for a time, and then Atar
led me back to the festival. I need not
repeat our speculations. Our questions soon
were to be answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We reached the roof-top. The swimming
and diving exhibitions were in progress—Marinoid
girls of beauty and grace, diving
from the overhead foliage down across the
brilliantly lighted cube of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw hoops of woven weed being held in
front of the palace—a dozen of them at
intervals. And Nona was just then poised,
ready for her dive. I held my breath staring
up to where her slim, pink-white figure
stood gracefully on the wavering end of a
huge, fan-like leaf high above me. A signal,
shouted by the King. Down Nona came
in a head-first dive. She hardly made a
ripple as she passed through the water.
Through one of the hoops she passed, then
swimming zig-zag through other hoops, up
and down, slowly turning over to pass a
hoop feet first, then doubled up, spinning
like a ball, and at last straightening out
again, swimming up and finishing on tip-toe
before the King, graceful as a swallow
alighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My beautiful Nona! Even the Marinoids—strange
as her mermaid beauty was to
them—applauded her loudly. And the King
smilingly touched her radiant cheek with
his. My own cheeks burned with the
pleasure of it, my pride in this girl of mine.
Presently she was back at my side, and I
was holding her close, while still they
applauded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then other girls dove. Then we ate.
And I, with Nona only, swam in time to
the music. Gayety. The pleasure of the
senses. And then like a thunder-clap came
a woman’s shrill cry of horror. The music
was stilled; silence, strange, uncanny, after
all that laughter, fell over the water. A
little knot of people were approaching the
King. I hurried there, found a Marinoid
girl of Gahna—a girl with frail body torn
and bleeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We laid her down; and to the King she
gasped out her news. The half-breeds had
risen into revolt. From Rax and all the
other Marinoid cities, they had gone to
Gahna. The city was in terror. Bloodshed.
And the Marinoid girls who resisted the
half-breeds were being killed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The half breed revolt! It had come!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Once before, I had been to Gahna.
It lay to one side, but fairly close
to the entrance to the Water of
Wild Things. Like Rax, it was built of
marine vegetation—a narrow cylinder standing
on end. There was a slight current
to the water here. The city sustained upright
by its air-pods overhead—nevertheless
leaned to one side under pressure of the
current. From a distance, it looked like
your leaning tower of Pisa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a beautiful city—less densely
populated and more beautiful than Rax.
Its exterior surfaces—its sides and top—were
laid out in parks and gardens. Large
houses, many-balconied, with ferns and
flowers. And the entire top one broad
public garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the King’s sleigh we went there now.
The water between the two cities was deserted.
We passed straggling figures coming
from Gahna—broken, bleeding figures—Marinoid
refugees escaping for their lives.
They came on, swimming slowly, painfully.
We passed a girl, floundering, then sinking
inert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ahead lay the dim distance. The water
was pale green with its glowing, inherent
light. Then it began tinting red. Atar
gripped me, trembling with the horror of
what we knew lay ahead; and the King
urged his dolphin faster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Gahna! The outlines of the city
loomed before us. A ring of hovering
predatory figures surrounded it! We could
see other figures launching themselves out
from the streets, desperately; and the waiting
figures surging upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We halted our dolphin; and presently,
still at a distance, we mounted over the
city, to gaze down into its garden roof. A
crowd of mermaids were huddled there—huddled
in groups, trying to hide in the
clumps of ferns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the half-breeds sought them out.
Swords flashed silver, then red. Faint
screams of agony floated up to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly we passed over the city. A Marinoid
girl clung to an air-pod. Three men,
dead-white of flesh, saw her there. They
dove at her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. their arms entwined her,
tore at her robe. Two of the men swam
aside, laughing. The other persisted; and
at the girl’s resistance he suddenly drew a
dagger and plunged it into her breast,
furious because his comrades were laughing
at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a balconied, terraced home.
Through the red haze that now stained the
water everywhere, we saw a man and woman
and little child huddled in a corner of the
roof. From a roof-doorway to the house
below, a group of half-breed men appeared.
They rushed at the Marinoid man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a
scuffle and the man lay dead. Two of the
assailants dragged the woman away .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
she was fighting them, screaming with
terror, and they cuffed her face to subdue
her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two half-breeds were left with
the child. One drew his sword, but the
other held him back, producing from his
robe a struggling white thing—a needle-fish.
Then they tossed the child upward
into the water, launched the fish at it.
Through the child’s soft body, the fish bore
its way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And everywhere it was the same. We
swung upward, beyond sound of the screams.
But the red in the water followed us.
Figures were plunging from the city at
every point; but few escaped the waiting
ring of half-breeds. The water darkened
with the blood that was added to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, sick at heart, we retraced our
way to Rax. And then the crowning blow.
Our guards at the entrance to the Water
of Wild Things had been set upon and
defeated. A few had escaped to bring the
news. Og’s Maagog army was advancing
through the coral! With our preparations
still incomplete, the Maagogs were striking!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The war had begun!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Maagogs were striking. The war
had begun!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not like to remember in detail the
scene around the King’s palace which
followed this sinister news. The city, so
gay, so carefree a few hours before, was
a turmoil of confusion, of terror—almost
of panic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the palace the people crowded. The
cube of water was jammed with a frightened,
expectant throng—a throng that
looked to its ruler for protection—for
advice, for commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This throng before the palace clamoured
for the King to tell them what to do. With
my Nona and Boy beside me I was inside
the building—in a room with the King and
Queen, Atar and Caan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall never forget that scene. To make
you appreciate it, I shall have to remind you
that never before in the reign of this King
had an enemy menaced his domains. And
this Marinoid civilization—as I now realize
it to have been—was very primitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a word, our King at this crisis was
flurried. His preparations for war were in
truth but vague and impractical. The Marinoids
did not know the meaning of an
army. Maagogs were coming to kill them;
Marinoids must fight in defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the extent of the King’s plans.
He sat in his carved shell on the throne-platform,
and we others crowded around
him anxiously. Outside the palace, the
shouts of the frightened mob floated in to
us through the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Maagogs!” said Atar. “They are
coming through the coral barrier! Our
guards there have been defeated—killed
most of them—and the rest have fled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming here?” I asked. “Will they
come here to Rax, do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King looked at us hopelessly. “Here—to
Rax? They cannot. I am not ready.
We must arm to repulse them. They must
not come so soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before this Time of Sleep is over they
will be here,” Caan declared gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of the King’s Councillors appeared
swimming into the room—old men, terrified
nearly out of their wits. They huddled
down beside us; and one of them said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the Cavern, my King, they are waiting
your orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shouts outside grew louder, more
insistent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The King!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the King?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him speak to us—tell us what to
do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are ready to fight! Death to the
Maagogs! Our King! We want our King!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father!” cried Atar. “Speak to them!
Command them! Now, or panic will come
and we are lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King rose to his feet uncertainly.
“Yes, speak to them—of course I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman swam hurriedly into the apartment—a
serving woman to the Queen. “My
King, the people are arriving from the
forests and the mudbanks. They are crowding
into Rax—they do not know where to
go or what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rural population! Coming into the
city for protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will speak to them,” the King repeated—he
said it numbly, as in a daze. “I must
tell them something.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Atar, my son,
we must plan something, you and I. But
there is no time—the Maagogs are coming
so soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that my Nona whispered to
me. Vehemently, with her soft arms entwined
about my neck. Inspiring words!
My blood raced hot through my veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You!” she insisted. “You, Nemo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where was I born? I do not know.
But I must have come from some great
civilization. Latent within me were powers
I little realized; and in that instant of crisis,
with the inspiration of Nona’s words, the
blood of my ancestors dominated me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I flung myself up into the water and
waved my arms at the astonished King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A leader!” I cried. “We Marinoids
need a man who will lead us to victory.
It is I—Nemo—who will command! Og
is coming. <span class='it'>I</span> will oppose him. I—the
Stranger—with my woman Nona!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I caught Atar’s excited gaze; I added:
“With you, Atar, to help me, we will win!”
The King was more confused than ever,
but I saw that he was pleased—relieved.
And my Nona’s eyes were upon me. Pride,
joy and love for me was in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” I said to the King. “I will talk
to the people, with you beside me. And
you will tell them that Nemo—the Stranger
within their gates—is in command!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>We went to a little balcony outside
the throne-room window. The
crowd fell silent when it saw us. At the
railing we stood beside each other, with
Nona, Atar and the rest crowding the doorway
behind us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King, with the responsibility of
leadership removed from him so unexpectedly,
had recovered his poise. He put
one of his arms about my shoulder as
smilingly he showed me to the people. It
was a throng so dense that all I could see
was a mass of faces and bodies. Silence,
then a wavering cheer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King extended his other arms; and
he told the hushed people that I was to be
their leader. They cheered; but there was
an ominous undercurrent of murmuring that
went with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was thinking swiftly—planning what I
would say—what I should tell them to do.
And I must admit that in that first moment,
I was confused myself. But no one should
see it. I knew that most of all I must
appear confident; and talk to them inspiringly—perhaps
bombastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My beloved people; the great God of
the Marinoids sent me to you,” I began.
“To lead you against this traitor Og.
Glorious times are ahead of us, my people.
Victory—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the murmur of dissent was growing!
A voice shouted a raucous jibe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait! Listen to me, all of you. This
Og, whom once I fought before you all—”
It was an unfortunate allusion; I had lost
that combat with Og. “Silence!” I shouted
over the noise. “Into the Water of Wild
Things I have just been—and from this
self-same Og recovered my woman Nona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the mingled cheers and jibes halted
me. I could feel that the King’s arm
around me was trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whispered to me quaveringly: “Go
on, Nemo. Tell them—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my Nona suddenly sprang forward,
up to the parapet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women of the Marinoids—” Her
voice to the women of the crowd rang out
clear and silenced the confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women of the Marinoids! This is war!
We women—our children—our homes, are
threatened! Do we fight, or do we sit by
while our men defend us? Women of the
Marinoids—answer me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did answer her. Their shouts of
applause came up—enthusiastic shouts of
the women in which the cheering voices of
the men were mingled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And over it all came Nona’s cry: “I
knew you would say that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My wonderful Nona! She was dominating
them. Her glorious arms—smooth as
pink marble—went out to them appealingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are but women, frail of body. But
the spirit of battle is strong within us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she called upon all the women who
were young and strong like herself—bade
them come now to the palace roof-top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come!” she cried. “Let us show our
men what sort of women are theirs. Come
now, and Nona—the Stranger’s woman—will
command you in the battle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came. From out of the crowd they
swam upward—the fairest, most beautiful
of the Marinoid girls—and settled upon the
palace roof. Two hundred of them perhaps.
It was inspiring. It could not help
but be—and my Nona knew it and had
planned it thus. The men, seeing them
gather, cheered loudly and called upon me
to lead them to protect their women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It saved the situation for the King and
me. Nona swam upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My man Nemo will command you
men,” she shouted. “And I will lead the
women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed down at me. “We women will
wait for your orders, my Nemo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And among the girls she took her place—waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had made my decisions. The crowd
now was with me. In a breath, I knew, the
news of my leadership would spread through
the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke. I knew that my voice now
carried the real confidence of authority;
and the crowd knew it. I commanded that
all the older women, old men and children
should go to their homes, bar their doors
and windows, and wait. All men, able-bodied,
I ordered to the roof of the city,
there to wait for their arms and equipment
which very soon would be furnished them.
They were to divide themselves into two
groups; older men whose power of giving
the electric shock was waning; and those
younger in whom it was still at its height.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>As I began giving orders, the things I
must do multiplied in my mind. A
score of the fastest swimmers in the city
I bade come to me at once in the throne-room
of the palace. I wished to send them
to the entrance of the Water of Wild
Things to bring us news of the enemy’s
advance; to send them throughout the
forests and the mudbanks—to order everyone
living there to come into Rax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were three other Marinoid cities
besides Rax and Gahna—small, unimportant
cities. My couriers would order them
to prepare as Rax was preparing—and send
their fighting men at once to the roof of
Rax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other things I thought of. Gahna, we
must abandon. Its Marinoid population
was massacred; the half-breeds held it in
full possession. I did not mention this
now to the crowd. But I told them that
every half-breed encountered in Rax was
to be killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The refugees coming here from the mudbanks,”
Atar whispered, to remind me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All refugees into Rax I ordered to divide
into two groups, the fighting men to come
to the roof of the city; the others, women,
old men and children, to seek quarters in
the homes of Rax. Any household would
take them in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people were dispersing, following my
orders. Nona, with her girls, was waiting
on the palace roof. I signed her to swim
down to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Select a girl to command them, under
you,” I said swiftly. “And my Nona, you
were wonderful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her caress answered me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give Boy to Caan’s woman, Nona—to
take home. Kiss him for me—our Boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in the haste of that moment, I remember
how thankful I was that Boy was
too young to fight. Yet Nona wished to
fight, you exclaim! True—but can you
guess how cold my heart was within me
at the thought of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Nona, join me in the throne-room.
We must go to the Cavern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I dispatched my couriers. And those I
sent to spy upon the enemy carried with
them my unspoken prayer that they would
bring back word we had at least a few hours
to prepare. A few hours! This Marinoid
was a very little nation, as <span class='it'>you</span> would reckon
it. Yet warfare cannot be planned upon
such short notice.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>My duties at the palace for the
moment were over. With Atar,
Caan and Nona, I hurried to the
Cavern. Atar led us—none of us others
had ever been there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not far from Rax—a broad entrance
cunningly disguised with removable
foliage. A tunnel, short and steeply downward,
led us under the sea-bottom. It was
dark. Lights at intervals illumined the
water—dim, wavering lights, lending to
everything a ghostly unreality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several times we were stopped; but at
sight of Atar the guards let us pass. Ahead
of us presently we could see more open
water—a broad shallow amphitheatre, artificially
lighted. Figures were moving about
in it, busy at various tasks. Human figures—most
of them, but not all. Some were
dolphins. And then I saw a great cage
within which two or three hundred of the
graceful creatures were swimming idly about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Atar to show us the way, we swam
slowly the length and breadth of the cavern.
Here, he said, were the weapons being
made. I looked them over. A thousand of
them possibly. Small, dagger-like things;
swords; others long as a lance; still others
very thin, but heavy in front to be thrown
through the water like javelins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of the weapons standing in
racks inspired me. With them, I could equip
a thousand fighting men. More perhaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further along we came upon a side cave.
In it I saw a dozen sleighs to be drawn
through the water by dolphins. They were
not unlike the King’s sleigh in which I had
already ridden upon two memorable occasions,
save that these were smaller—to carry
one man only. And slimmer, with streamlines,
so that they might offer a minimum
of resistance in passing through the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I examined them more closely. Each had
along its sides, banks of lights—small, torpedo-shaped
pods filled with extraordinarily
luminous organisms. The lights were shrouded;
but Atar uncovered those of one sleigh.
A blinding glare, pointing only forward,
shot like a search-light beam through the
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These “light-sleighs,” Atar explained,
were designed to precede an advancing
army. They would blind the enemy,
throw him into clear light. And in the comparative
darkness behind them, our Marinoid
forces could advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We passed along—quickly, for we had
little time for these explanations. Atar was
giving orders; the workmen were preparing
everything for immediate action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other sleighs—“sleighs of
darkness.” These were in shape like the
others—but larger, for two men. Around
them were ink-bags. I remembered the squid
which had attacked us in the Water of Wild
Things. These bags, when squeezed, emitted
an inky fluid—a screen of darkness that
could be thrown over the scene of battle
at any critical moment of disaster or retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was enumerating in my mind the forces
at my command. I had men famed for
their power of giving the electric shock. I
would use them in a separate division—to
combat the black fishes or the Maagogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black fishes! My heart sank as I
thought of them. Fearless! Suicidal little
brutes whose only instinct was to fight until
death. How many of them would Og have
to hurl against us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we had dolphins. I demanded of
Atar what the dolphins were for. There
were several hundred of them, and a score
or so were all that could be needed to draw
the sleighs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our men will ride them,” said Atar.
“Small, slim, very skillful men will have to
be chosen. Men without the electric power.
It would be useless on a dolphin. We can
arm these men with the long, thin spears.
They can go swiftly, anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such words on the very eve of battle!
How would we have time to select such
men, train them? And where were the men?
There were no small, slim, skillful men except
among the younger group whose electric
power would be more valuable to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again had I reckoned without Nona. Her
eyes were shining, her beautiful face flushed
with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We women will ride your dolphins.
Small, slim, skillful—without the electric
power—we are the ones you need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then I protested. Indeed, I tried
my best to get her to stay with Boy, at
home. I failed. And now I realize that in
spite of my fears for her, I was more proud
of her then than I had ever been before.
My Nona!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A single dolphin out of its cage,
swam past us—sleek, graceful creature
longer than my body, its every line denoting
speed. Atar called to it. Like a dog
it came and fawned upon us. With her
arm about its neck, Nona caressed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This one will I ride,” she exclaimed.
“Let me try now. Atar, make him let me
try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar summoned a young Marinoid—one
who had helped train the dolphins. He
showed Nona how to mount it. She had on
an outer garment at the moment, and at the
lad’s direction she discarded it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he brought thongs of grass, and
bound her hair tightly around her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was ready. Lying flat on the dolphin’s
back, her slender body seemed welded
to it. A collar was about the dolphin’s
head; and into it she thrust an arm to hold
herself. The young Marinoid told her how
the creature was guided. A kick of the
heel, pressure of an arm against its head—or
even a whispering word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was away! Back and forth through
the water before us the dolphin sped; and
Nona’s body flat against it caused hardly a
ripple. Then they gave her one of the
long, lance-like spears. She carried it; held
it poised; flashed it above her, below—lunging
at imaginary enemies, as the dolphin
darted out under her commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grace and skill of it! I was amazed.
Woman, with such a thing, learns faster
than man. Soon she was twisting her body
down to use the dolphin as a shield, lunging
with the lance over its back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she dashed over to where we were
waiting, and slipped to the cave floor, standing
there panting and triumphant—a little
jockey, flushed with victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, my Nemo? We women can do
it! We will ride your dolphins!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour or more had gone by. For another,
we talked and planned, Atar, Caan
and I. Nona had taken the dolphins with
their four trainers—taken them to the palace
roof to organize the girls. Soon our messengers
would return from the Water of
Wild Things with the news of the enemy’s
progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went up to the palace to join Nona.
The men from the cavern under Caan’s
direction were on the roof of the city, distributing
weapons to our forces gathered
there. I had no sooner reached the palace
than one of my couriers came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good news! Good news indeed! The
Maagog forces were not coming at once to
Rax. Gahna was in the hands of their half-breed
allies. It was closer to them than
Rax. They were heading for Gahna, occupying
it—massing there; and from there,
doubtless, would presently attack us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the breathing space we wanted—needed
so badly. Now we could organize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona with her dolphin was with me as
the courier poured out his news. Quick-witted,
fertile-minded woman! Never will I
cease to marvel at her. She whispered to
me a plan—daring—yet almost certain of
success. A plan that she and I alone could
execute. A plan.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But presently you
shall hear it in detail, for we lost no time
in attempting it.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Nona and I started, each on a dolphin,
and each bearing a short, broad-bladed
sword. Only Atar knew where we
were going, or what we were about to try
and do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Riding the dolphins, we started slowly at
first, for I was inexperienced. The creature’s
sleek body was beneath me and I
clung to it, stretching myself out along its
back, my fingers gripping its woven-grass
collar. Nona rode ahead on a dolphin
slightly smaller, but, I soon was to learn,
equally as fast as my own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo, are you all right?” Her sober,
earnest little face was turned back toward
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” I said. “Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would you let a woman know when you
were perturbed? Not I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once Nona increased the pace, and my
own mount followed hers. We were leaving
the city, passing out along one of its horizontal
streets. It was nearly deserted. The
fighters had gone to the city roof; the
others were barred in their darkened houses.
Occasionally a face would show at a window.
A courier came along—returning from
one of the other cities. We stopped him.
My orders were being obeyed, he reported,
the fighters from the other cities were swimming
in to join our own men on the roof of
Rax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sent the courier on to the palace to
receive further orders from Atar. We
wished to spread the news that the enemy
was not attacking at once. And while Nona
and I were away on this enterprise, Atar
and Caan were to organize the army; and
the girl whom Nona had appointed, was to
drill the other girls in riding the dolphins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We passed on, out of Rax. As we left
the city—heading for our first objective, the
entrance to the Water of Wild Things—I
caught a glimpse of the roof of Rax. The
open spaces up there were thronged with
our men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona increased our pace and very soon
Rax with its activities was left out of sight
in the dimness behind us. The open water
was almost deserted. Refugees were straggling
in; occasionally we came upon parties
of them—families who had fled from their
isolated homes. They all halted and gazed
after us curiously as we dashed past them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Nemo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went faster. The water pressed
against me, roared in my ears, blurred my
vision. I clung tighter, and bent my head in
the crook of my arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, after a time that seemed ages but
was doubtless very brief, we slackened.
Nona signalled to me, and I rode my dolphin
close alongside of hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See,” she whispered. “We are here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ahead of us in the dim water, moving
lights showed. We were almost at the
entrance to the Water of Wild Things. The
last of the Maagog forces were coming
through. We did not dare go close enough
to see much. Moving lights disclosed double
lines of swimming figures. They were
coming out through the passageway they
had cut in the coral, and swimming off toward
Gahna. The line of their lights extended
out of sight in that direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were just in time to see the last of
them come through. Og and his black
fishes! We assumed it was Og; we had
gone closer, but not close enough to distinguish
features. A lone male figure carrying
a light and surrounded by that swarming
pack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The figure closed the passageway gate at
this end carefully. Like ourselves, Og
wanted no unruly monsters to get through
into Marinoid waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We waited until his single light was well
on its way to Gahna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can follow now,” I said. “Nona—we
will succeed. We can do it, my girl—and
it is you who have planned it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not answer me; she had already
started her dolphin. Like shadows in the
gloom, silently, without a ripple of the
water as we slipped through it, we followed
close after the Maagog invading army.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>To Gahna. It took us a long while
to get there, for the Maagog army advanced
slowly. Following the lights
we found ourselves descending at once to the
sea-bottom. These Maagogs, lumbering and
ungainly, were poor swimmers; the line of
them was walking along the bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It made my heart leap to realize that.
What match would they be for us Marinoids
in battle—our men so active in the water—our
alert girls on the dolphins. We would
cut them to pieces .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. would rout .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I whispered my thoughts to Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be not too sure, my Nemo,” she said
soberly. “It may be so but first we must
do what we are now planning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went on, through the forest road
where the Maagogs had tramped aside the
tall, tenuous growth of foliage. It was much
dimmer in here. Beside us the trees and
ferns spread as a dark lacework of green
and brown. They met overhead, wavering,
tenuous, but impenetrable to our sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a spot for ambush! A thousand
hiding-places all about us. An army could
lurk here in ambush unseen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is very easy to look backwards upon
life and say what should have been done.
We Marinoids—how stupidly we had done
things! Our army—if it had been organized
and ready—could have lurked here in
this dark forest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. leaped upon the
Maagogs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. defeated them at once in one
great surprise attack .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” I whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona, from her dolphin beside mine, had
reached out and gripped my arm. I followed
her gaze, caught a glimpse of a figure
hovering amid the air-pods overhead and
just in advance of us. A man, coming
down now toward us, swimming cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My heart leaped; my grip on my sword
tightened. Then I saw it was a Marinoid—one
of my own couriers stationed here to
watch the enemy pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He joined us. “Og,” he said, “and his
black fishes were last to pass. I would have
given my own life to the fishes could I have
killed him. But it did not seem possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sent the courier back to Rax and we
went on as before. Out of the forest now,
across an open stretch, with the lights of
the Maagogs still before us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then—Gahna. There it stood, leaning
sidewise in the press of current. Traveling
so slowly, we could feel the sweep of the
moving water. A gentle current here; but
just beyond Gahna, I knew there was an
opening in the side wall of rock which
bordered in the Marinoid domain. It was a
large opening leading diagonally downward—an
opening larger than the city itself—and
into it the water rushed swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait!” whispered Nona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We halted our mounts, and waited while
the last of the occupying Maagogs dispersed
themselves about the city. From this distance
we could see their lights but hear no
sounds. Evidences of the recent half-breed
massacre of the Marinoid population, were
about us. Broken, inert bodies lying here
and there on the sea-bottom; and the smell
of blood in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shuddered to remember it. Gahna,
bloody from end to end—a city of death
now; and these triumphant Maagogs occupying
it, making it a base from which to
attack Rax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last they were all in. Cautiously, we
advanced further. Moving lights on the
city’s outer surface—a murmur of sounds.
Nothing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments and we were under the
city! In its cellar, let me say. No one
lived down here; sand under our feet;
woven vegetation twenty feet overhead—a
cellar ceiling which formed the lowest tier
of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was black in here; and almost soundless,
just the murmur of the city above us.
We stood motionless, listening. Were we
alone? Dared we light our lights? I knew
that if they caught us in here we could not
escape. Yet we could see nothing without
lights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We unshrouded them finally—little pods
which threw tiny wavering green beams.
With them, we poked around, cautiously,
with our swiftly beating hearts seeming
about to smother us.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Gahna was a small city. Four thick
stalks of vegetation—each about twice
the thickness of my body—formed its main
stems. I stood beside one of them, dug my
sword into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within five minutes, I had hacked through
the stem. Nona held the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quietly,” she whispered. “If they should
hear us—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stalk was severed. A tremor seemed
to run over the upper part, and it moved
slightly sidewise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trembling ourselves, we attacked another.
Severed it; then the third.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city over us was shifting, toppling.
The fourth stalk was twisted and bent by
the strain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I severed it with a few
blows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swim! Nona! Quickly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ceiling overhead was lifting—shifting.
Smaller stalks and vines which had
taken root in the sand were tearing away.
Above us came a cry—shouts—confusion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We swam to extricate ourselves. Tearing
vines seemed to leap at us, but we avoided
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back to our dolphins. They were waiting;
we mounted them—turned to look at
the city. It was turning over in the water,
and floating away. Slowly, then faster, down
toward that black opening into which the
current would sweep it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city of death! But every living thing
in it was pouring out. Lights—dark blobs
of figures—shouts—commands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Maagogs were escaping! In a turmoil;
and they would lose whatever apparatus
they had for war; but they were escaping
nevertheless. We had hoped the catastrophe
would come more quickly. But it
did not. The city toppled slowly over, while
those terrified figures leaped from it. Slowly
it floated away—then plunged into the torrent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was gone with its murdered Marinoid
dead; but on the sand, and in the water
ahead of us, the Maagogs and the half-breeds
remained. Some had gone to their
death, no doubt; the others .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will not wait to attack us now,”
Nona whispered suddenly. “We have crippled
them, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must get back,” I exclaimed. “It is
we who must attack at once—finish them up—now,
before they can recover—”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>In Rax, we found Atar with his work
well done. We Marinoids were ready.
And within an hour or very little more, we
set forth to meet the advancing Maagogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I led my army out of Rax. The details of
its organization I had left to Atar and Caan,
while Nona and I were on our expedition
to Gahna. They had done their work well;
and within an hour after our return we were
ready to leave—to face the advancing Maagog
forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left from the roof of Rax. The broad,
open space there was ample for mobilization,
and in the center of it my forces were gathered.
<span class='it'>You</span> of a greater civilization, might
call this army of mine meager. Yet to us
Marinoids it was huge—the largest group of
fighting men these people had ever conceived
of organizing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some two thousand men, girls and dolphins—the
product of all the Marinoid cities
and the rural population. We had many
more who wanted, and were able, to join
us. But these I left at home—some in Rax,
some in the other, smaller cities. So that at
home—in the event of disaster to our fighters
in the open water—we would not be
quite defenseless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An army of two thousand! It was not
very much, of course; but it was equipped
and organized—with a plan of action which
I shall tell you in a moment. That it would
be ample for victory, I did not doubt. Og
and his Maagogs might outnumber us—of
that I could not say. But we had fighting
qualities which the slow lumbering Maagogs
could not possibly equal. We would be
easily victorious, I thought; but Nona was
not so sanguine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of my commands the people of
Rax, many of them, had gathered on the
city roof to see us leave; a circular fringe
of them jammed the edge of the roof, waiting
to cheer our departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they did not cheer. With solemn
faces they stared upward at our columns as
we rose into the water—women staring after
their husbands and sons, even their daughters—women
and old men staring, and wondering
which of their loved ones would return
alive to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In command of the entire Marinoid
forces, I rode alone on a dolphin—with
hands free and with only a lance fastened
flat against the dolphin’s back and a dagger
in my belt. I was first off the roof of Rax.
As I rose, gliding smoothly upward and
outward, I looked down to see the city dropping
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A column of young men, swimming five
abreast, came up next—like birds rising in
orderly array to follow their lone leader. It
was an inspiring sight—this sinuous curving
line of swimmers. It swung into the water,
bent like a huge rainbow over the city,
straightened, and followed me diagonally
upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon Rax had dwindled small and dim in
the water below. But I could see Nona’s
forces—the girls mounted on dolphins—as
they too were starting. Then Rax, now so
far beneath me, blurred and was lost in the
gray-green haze of water; and I turned my
attention ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The backbone of my army was the line of
young men swimming five abreast behind
me. Five hundred of them there were—young,
powerful swimmers—youths at the
height of their physical strength. Each was
by nature capable of shocking into insensibility
with an electric discharge, any opponent
he could touch by head and heels simultaneously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These young men were unarmed; I felt
that they could use their natural weapon to
better advantage when swimming free-handed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona’s corps consisted of some two hundred
girls mounted on dolphins. Each with
a long, lance-like spear in her hands. Nona
commanded them—with ten extra girls, each
to control a group of twenty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was Atar’s corps of sleighs—the
“light-sleighs” which I have already described.
Atar himself had a dolphin mount.
In each of the ten dolphin-drawn sleighs
was a single occupant—an older man. These
sleighs I would use to precede us—to throw
light upon the enemy, blind him, and cover
our onslaught made from behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “sleighs of darkness”—ten of them,
dolphin-drawn, and each with two occupants—were
commanded by Caan, himself riding
a separate dolphin. These sleighs were for
darkening the water in the event of a catastrophe
to our fighters—to cover our retreat
wherever it might be necessary.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest, my main forces were a
thousand fighting men—older men in
whom the electric power was waning. They
were armed with various types of spears—daggers,
javelins and lances. They were
leaving Rax in a long swimming line some
ten abreast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was my army which now was following
me into battle. I led it upward.
Behind me I could see the long columns of
swimming figures—the sleighs in two broad
groups—the girls on the dolphins in squads
of twenty, each with its leader apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ahead of me lay open water—a gray-green
in the half-light, dim and blurred.
Far overhead I knew was the rocky ceiling
which marked the top of this watery, subterranean
world; and the ooze and sand of
the sea-bottom was perhaps two thousand
feet beneath me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was heading for Gahna. The water
here was almost free of vegetation, but not
wholly so. Occasionally thin, waving spires
of seaweed, covered with air-pods to sustain
them, reared their heads. I threaded
my way among them; and with every turn
I made, the line of swimming figures behind
me followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon I conjectured I must be half-way to
the former site of Gahna. The Maagogs
would probably follow the sea-bottom in
their advance, for they were all indifferent
swimmers, flabby of muscle and short of
breath. It was time for me to descend and
locate them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I waited—as it had been prearranged that
I should wait at this point; and as I hung
poised in a broad stretch of empty water,
my army swung up and gathered. In two
huge concentric circles, the men swam slowly
around me, while the girls on the dolphins
moved lazily back and forth above
and below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A beautiful sight, these girls—slim bodies
clinging closely to the sleek backs of their
graceful mounts. And Caan and Atar with
their squads of sleighs holding motionless
on the outskirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the center of it all, Nona rode her
dolphin to join me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are all ready, Nemo.” And she
laughed gaily; though searching her face, I
could see no laughter in her solemn eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told her then to wait while I went down
to the sea-bottom to locate the enemy. She
nodded; and I left her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly I drove my dolphin around the
circle of my men—shouting a word of encouragement
here and there. I consulted
a moment with Caan and Atar; waved at
Nona as I passed her again, and dove my
mount downward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ring of waiting figures above me
faded into dimness and were lost. I was
alone in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took but a few moments to reach the
bottom; it came up to me, by optical illusion
tilted vertically on end. A hundred
feet above it I righted my mount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was over a level floor of sand, with
cactus-like growths here and there. Empty;
there was no sign of Maagogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ahead of me, in the direction of where
Gahna had once stood, I saw the shadows
of a forest. I advanced toward it; and from
it were emerging the first lines of the oncoming
enemy.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>But my heart sank. There were very
many of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once I raced my dolphin upward. And
my thoughts were racing also. Again I had
lost another opportunity for ambush. Had
we reached the forest before the Maagogs
began to emerge, we might have surprised
them there. The forest was several miles
long and a mile broad perhaps, in the horizontal
direction from Gahna to Rax. A mile
of thick vegetation—tree spires and a tangle
of vines and weeds rearing themselves several
thousand feet up into the water. The
Maagog army was now traversing that mile-width
of forest. Perhaps, if I could cut
them off in there—attack them piecemeal
as they emerged.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was again with my own forces. Nona,
Atar and Caan rode their mounts hastily to
meet me, and I told them the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took us but a moment to decide. We
would maintain this upper open water as
our base. I ordered Atar with his light-sleighs
and half of our electric fighting
men, to follow me down. I would attack
these first columns of the enemy as they
came out of the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona, with her girls, was to ride swiftly
above the forest, descend on its other side
and drive the last of the Maagogs in. We
did not want any of them to retreat toward
Gahna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I waited, while Nona with the dolphins
dashed upward and away. The girls had all
been flushed and eager; but as they swept by
me in a line I saw that each little face was
white, set and grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They vanished in a swirl of water. I
wheeled my dolphin toward Atar. His ten
light-sleighs were in a line abreast, with him
on his dolphin behind them. He gave a
signal. The pods on the sleighs were unshrouded.
Green light leaped ahead—a
broad, blinding glare; and in the semi-darkness
behind it, my electric men were
gathered around me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I shouted my command, and we
started vertically downward—our first attack
upon the enemy.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The glare of light showed the water
plainly—a brilliant, ghastly green.
We reached the sea-bottom, turned
and dashed forward. The Maagogs were
there. They saw our light coming of course,
long before we saw them. A crowd of them,
confused, half-blinded, but they were standing
their ground nevertheless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the line of light-sleighs I saw that
we had to deal here with perhaps five hundred
Maagog men. They seemed armed
with spears. They huddled heavily against
the sea-bottom, some half a mile from the
edge of the forest. The line of them
stretched back there, and more were constantly
coming out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When our sleighs were no more than a
few hundred yards away, I shouted at Atar.
At his relayed signal, the sleighs shrouded
their pods and turned upward, out of reach
of the enemy. It left the water in semi-darkness—blackness
it must have seemed to the
Maagogs, with that blinding glare so suddenly
extinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then we leaped at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a swirl of confusion, this hand-to-hand
warfare. I held my dolphin resolutely
above it, taking no part, but watching for
every advantage into which I might hurl
my men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking down into the swirling water I
could see the Maagogs fighting desperately
to impale my swimmers with their spears.
And my young Marinoids, darting over
them, up and down, seeking to touch them
head and legs simultaneously that the electric
shock might kill them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fighting spread. Soon it was going
on over a wide area. It was almost silent,
uncanny fighting. The swish of the churning
water—a shout, a death scream here and
there. Bodies were dotting the sand. Maagogs,
but Marinoids too. And the Maagogs
in this first engagement outnumbered us
two to one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was perhaps fifty feet above the sand,
with the sleighs poised inactive immediately
over me. Atar dashed up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are they doing? Nemo, would it
be better in the light?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had not thought of that. A trio of
Maagogs, wounded and confused, came
floundering up at us. Atar, from his dolphin,
dispatched them easily with his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lights!” he shouted. “Lights—and
spread out—to light it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lights flashed on; the sleighs moved
away to separate positions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As though on a lighted stage, the scene
was now illumined. It was a good move,
for the Maagogs, living in the dark Water
of Wild Things, could not stand the light
as well as we could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back to the edge of the forest the fighting
was in progress. But my heart sank.
There were two Maagogs dead to every Marinoid;
but it was not enough. These were
the weakest of Og’s forces—and I was using
against them the best of mine. Half an
hour more of such fighting and these first
columns would be cut to pieces and routed.
But what of that, if I lost nearly half of my
finest men? There were the black fishes
yet to cope with. My electric men would
do best against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw now my mistake. I should have
fought these lumbering Maagogs with my
older, more numerous men. Spears against
spears—and saved my youth for the black
fishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar, I think, came to these conclusions
simultaneously. Together we dashed over
the scene of battle, calling off our fighters.
They came readily, for the Maagogs, sorely
harassed, were glad enough to let them go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up we started, but there were now no
more than a hundred of us, where before
there had been more than twice that. The
light-sleighs, again shrouded, followed us.
In the dimness down there, the sea-bottom
was strewn with inert, broken figures—the
wounded floundering—the water darkened
with blood. And over toward the forest
the Maagogs were retreating, to join fresh
columns coming out. Then as we rose, the
scene faded into obscurity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must get back up,” Atar called to
me. “Get our older men—all of them—and
come down again at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were rising to where our waiting
army would soon come into view, when off
to the left I saw a cloud of tiny forms coming
out of the upper recesses of the forest.
Dashing at us, to cut off our ascent!
Swiftly. I saw at once that our swimmers
could not avoid them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black fishes! A swarm of them,
with Og in their midst, was upon us!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I must go back now to when—previous
to our first attack—Nona with her girls
left us to cross the forest. Nona led them;
and swimming at tremendous speed they
were soon above the vegetation. It was a
queer sight, looking down through the water
upon those marine tree-tops. A tangle
of weeds; air-pods, some of them gigantic—the
whole forest a matted thicket on top
of which one could lie at rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there were many places which would
have served as entrance down or exit up;
which latter thought made my Nona shiver
involuntarily. Down in the tangle—two
thousand feet down—the Maagogs were
passing through. What forces did they
have? How many men? How many of the
dreaded black fishes? Where were those
black fishes—from which point would they
attack us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona knew that the fishes could best be
fought by our electric men. The little
beasts would be easy to shock and kill—but
not easy, since they were so small, to impale
upon a lance. Nona wondered where
they were. If only she could get information
of the strength and disposition of the
enemy forces—information for me, so that
I might intelligently plan my battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Woman acts upon impulse. Nona called
her girl leaders—directed them to go on and
carry out my orders—drive the Maagogs into
the forest from its side toward Gahna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then abruptly she halted her dolphin;
the others swept on, leaving her alone in
the silence of the water above the forest. At
once she fastened her lance to the dolphin’s
back and dismounted; and the dolphin, understanding
her reiterated, whispered command,
held itself poised to await her return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona planned to go down alone—swimming
free-handed—into the forest to spy
upon the enemy. She wasted no time; finding
an open space between the tall spires,
she dove into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The descent through those tangled, tenuous
air-pods and plants, was laborious. She
worked her way down, quietly, surreptitiously.
It was almost dark, though not quite;
and very silent. Far below now, she thought
she could hear the sound of voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was perhaps two-thirds the way down,
when a sudden movement near at hand
caused her heart to leap. Something human!
She shrank behind a waving leaf, and
clung. Peering into the gloom she saw a
human figure—a Maagog. A woman—seemingly
unarmed—a small female figure
huddling in a branch of vegetation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Maagog! Nona could capture her—force
from this enemy woman the information
she sought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Nona plunged forward, her arms outstretched.
Plunged silently, swiftly; and
she was upon her enemy before the Maagog
was fully aware of her. Their bodies met;
the Maagog woman (she was no more than
a girl) screamed; but Nona’s hand went
over her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fought, tore at each other, with the
Maagog girl’s four arms gripping my
Nona’s frail body like the tentacles of an
octopus. But Nona was the stronger; her
body built of firmer flesh; her muscles
more powerful.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly the Maagog girl yielded.
They had been tumbling over and
over in the water—wound and entangled
with sea-weed; and save for that one scream,
fighting silently. Nona pulled her captured
antagonist to a tree-stalk, and in one of its
branches, held her there firmly. And not
until then did she realize that this was
Maaret, the girl who loved Og—the girl
who had helped us escape from the Water
of Wild Things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maaret now was crying. “What do
you want of me? You go away. I hate
you. You tried to take my Og. You let
me alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women are strange creatures! My Nona
put her arms tenderly about the vehement
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not hate me, Maaret. What
are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Og—he is down there. Fighting. For
you, he fights—<span class='it'>you</span>, the woman who stole
his heart. And he may be killed, and I
love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could Nona say? This girl had
followed Og to battle—followed, hoping to
keep him out of danger, because she loved
him. And at the last, frightened, she had
crawled away to the treetops—crying with
fear and misery when Nona set upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maaret, listen. You tell me where the
black fishes are. Where is your Og?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There—in the forest.” It was a vague
answer—a gesture, not down, but off to one
side, toward Rax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still in the forest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I think so—I don’t know. But
he was going out to fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The black fishes were with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many of them, Maaret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girl had become suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” she said sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is on the sea-bottom with them?
Maaret, listen. How many Maagogs are
there in the forest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girl understood Nona’s purpose
and set her lips tight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, Maaret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” burst out the girl. “You would
do my Og harm. I want to help him, not
you.” She tried to pull away, but Nona
held her. Nona’s anger was rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you with me,” she told the girl.
“My Nemo will make you talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maaret resisted, and suddenly her
tears came afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You let me go. I should be with Og—fighting
beside him because I love him. I
was a coward to come up here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words appealed as none others could
to Nona. Her anger vanished; sympathy
flooded over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to fight for Og, Maaret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! I want to fight—I belong there—beside
him. Let me go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nona stared into the girl’s pathetic little
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go,” she said. “You speak truth, Maaret.
You belong there with the man you
love, no matter for what cause he fights.
Go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her gaze followed as Maaret dropped
away, down into the recesses of the forest.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was a terrible moment as we saw
those black fishes, with Og in their
midst, dashing at us. Atar and I shouted
to our men—shouted encouragement. We
could not avoid this new enemy; and so
we had to plunge at it with a will. A hundred
electric men, no more, and all of them
were exhausted by the combat they had
left but a moment before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our light-sleighs were of little use here;
hastily we sent them speeding upward, to
bring down our main army to our assistance.
Atar and I on our dolphins circled about.
The black fishes were everywhere; confusion
again; the lashing figures of our young men
as they met the black, ugly little things—all
jaws, and teeth like needles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred personal battles simultaneously.
But there were ten fishes to each of our
men at least. The fishes were shocked and
killed—some of them. Others bit and tore
at our fighters’ flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Have you ever seen a school of hungry
fish pluck at a bit of food? Dismember it—carry
it away? This was like it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shuddering, I dashed my dolphin to and
fro. A few of the fishes I caught on my
lance. But so very few among that thousand.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was disaster. We would kill half
the fishes perhaps—but lose all this portion
of our men. Disaster.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I became aware of Atar’s dolphin rushing
past me; his voice shouting:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Og! Let us get Og! Force him to call
off the fishes! Or kill him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Og had been holding himself poised in
midwater, watching the scene. But already
he had realized the danger. He was making
away; and at his call a hundred or more of
his fishes gathered around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We would have dashed at them; our two
dolphins could have scattered them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we did not; for from below, a swarm
of other figures appeared. Marinogs! The
half-breeds! A picked corps of Marinog
youths. They were good swimmers. They
possessed the power of electric shock. More
than a hundred of them were rising now to
Og’s assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar and I stopped our onslaught. Around
us on every hand our scattered forces were
fighting the fishes. But the little groups of
men fighting were now very few; everywhere
bodies were sinking inert, with
swarms of fishes plucking at them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We screamed for all to follow us who
could; and mounted. A few of our men
tried to follow—but not one succeeded. The
oncoming Marinogs, fresh and lustful,
caught them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with hearts cold within us, Atar and
I dashed on upward, alone.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Nona regained her mount above the
forest and continued on to join her
girls. I can tell you this part of the
battle only as Nona told it to me—briefly,
for my Nona talks little of her own deeds.
The girls on the dolphins were beyond the
forest, down near the sea-bottom. And they
were engaged with the enemy when Nona
arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the last of the Maagog columns,
just entering the forest when the dolphins
attacked it. A very brief engagement. A
few score of the last, heavy-swimming Maagogs.
And without trouble the girls cut
them down—drove them into the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar and I, rising alone from our defeat,
met our main army coming down to help
us. The light-sleighs had carried the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily we told them of our disaster. It
was my fault, no doubt; I should never have
split my forces. How easy it is to look back
and say what should have been done!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar was anxious to descend at once, with
all our men, in one desperate attack. But
I was learning the art of warfare. Inexperienced
still, yet now not wholly so. We
must wait here, I told them, for Nona and
the girls to return. And by then the enemy
would be on this side of the forest. In the
open, we would attack them with all our
forces at once, as Atar said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” shouted Atar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above us, in the direction of the forest,
the blur of swiftly moving forms showed,
with lines of white, V-shaped, behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Nona and the girls—victorious in
what they had undertaken. The news heartened
us. We had lost a few of the girls
and dolphins—and two hundred and fifty
of our best men. But we had done the
enemy all told a more than equal amount
of damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For half an hour we waited. Atar and
I twice cautiously descended. The Maagogs
seemed all out of the forest—and were advancing
on Rax. High over them in the
water, we followed; and almost within sight
of Rax, we dove down in a mass upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a scene of carnage which at first
seemed inextricable confusion. My forces
spread out—attacked the enemy everywhere
at once. The Maagogs seemed to prefer the
sea-bottom; they clung there and fought
stubbornly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Atar’s insistence, I held my dolphin
at first in mid-water, out of range of the
fighting. Below me was the center of the
struggling mass—the main force of sword-armed
Maagogs. Against them, in the glare
of Atar’s light-sleighs, I hurled my older
men. They were fighting down there in the
brilliant light. We were outnumbered in
this section, but I could see that my men
were more than holding their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off to the left—toward the forest—a
cloud of the black fishes had come up. With
them were the Marinog electric men; and
against them I sent my own two hundred
and fifty youths—and the girls and dolphins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was this segment that I most feared. I
could see them now; the men were locked
in hand-to-hand conflict—lashing the water—hundreds
of little groups. The black
fishes were mingled with them; and about
the whole struggling mass, the girls on the
dolphins dashed back and forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long I watched I do not know. I
was alone, save that near at hand were Caan
and his dark-sleighs, holding themselves in
readiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Marinoid fighter came wavering up to
me, wounded and gasping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I descended. The fighters in this central
melee had split into two separate sections—and
on one side were far outnumbered. Atar
was down here; he saw me, and rushed forward.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Nemo—on this side we lose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible to transfer
quickly any considerable number of my men
from one side to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the lights from the losing side,” I
shouted; and when Atar had dashed away,
I swam my mount up to Caan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his dark-sleighs, we swept down
into the threatened area. Men were fighting
all around us; the dead were everywhere.
The ink-bags on the sleighs released
their fluid; the water darkened—turning to
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back and forth I scurried through the
darkness, screaming to my men to shake off
their foes—to extricate themselves and rise
into the light. In the blackness my dolphin
struck many struggling forms—friend and
foe alike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I went up, out of the cloud of ink,
again into the blessed light. And waited,
while in little groups, my sorely pressed
fighters struggled up after me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was instinct for everyone to escape
from that horrible darkness. Have you ever
fought in the dark? It strikes a terror to
the soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Maagogs must have felt it, as well
as my own men. In the black, inky water,
all fighting soon ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here I saw my opportunity and
grasped it. The Maagogs, confused and
terror-stricken, were floundering out into the
light. They came singly. And their eyes—weaker
than those of the Marinoids—could
see little when first they emerged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many minutes the inky water held together.
And around its edges, Atar with
his light-sleighs swept their dazzling beams
back and forth. There were six or seven
hundred Maagogs in there—and as they
came out a few at a time, we fell upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was our great opportunity. And then
I realized that I could do the same thing
with the other wing. If only I had my
other forces here! The girls with the dolphins!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atar and Caan executed the same maneuver
while I dashed away to get Nona. In
this third sector things had gone very well
indeed. The girls had suffered few casualties.
They were fighting the Marinogs—holding
them in check, while my electric
men dispatched the black fishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I searched about for Nona, came upon
her in time to see what manner of warfare
this was. Three Marinogs had made for
her. She went at them full tilt, with lance
extended. They scattered; but incredibly
swiftly she turned her dolphin, impaled one
of them with her lance—then another, while
the third for his life, turned and made away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nona!” I called. “Bring your girls!
Come—we need you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the girls behind me, I hastened back
to Atar and Caan. Out of the inky water
below—into the brilliant beams of our light-sleighs—the
surprised Maagogs were emerging.
The girls rushed at them—the dolphins,
extraordinarily swift, seemed to be
everywhere at once.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ink finally cleared away; and my
own remaining fighters took a hand. The
combat turned to slaughter—then a complete
rout.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I had men free now to send to the
other sector, weakened by the withdrawal
of the girls. The black fishes and the Marinogs
there were overpowered. The fishes
fought to the last. A few of the Marinogs
fled—back to the Water of Wild Things.
And from everywhere about the scene of
battle, wounded Maagogs were floundering
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we let them go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had won.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>Concluding Statement by Ray Cummings</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I feel that I should add a few words
to this manuscript given me by
“Nemo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This queer old man has been writing for
me these memories of his youth. But the
Institution officials, with pardonable skepticism,
declare to me privately that he is
unbalanced—a victim of amnesia since that
day he was found wandering on the streets
of an American city, with no memory of
who he was or where he came from. They
tell me he was, in his youth, probably some
obscure European astronomer—which would
account for his scientific knowledge. Scandinavian
perhaps, they now say. His accent
is curious, I can hear for myself. But
I would not call it Scandinavian; indeed I
have heard nothing like it anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not so many weeks ago—dating
from the time you read this—when I interviewed
the old man, in the neat little reception
room of the Institution. I read over
this manuscript which he handed me, while
he sat staring with eyes that seemed to see
far beyond the narrow walls enclosing us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Nemo,” I protested, “this is not
finished. Is this the last you’re going to
give me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last,” he said vaguely. “I cannot
remember any more. It is getting blurred—fading.”
He passed a palsied hand across
his blue-veined forehead. “Getting blurred—for
I am an old man and my faculties are
going—very fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Og,” I suggested. “What became
of Og?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brightened. “Did I not tell you that?
I remember now. I met him—near the end
of the battle. He had captured one of our
dolphins, and a lance. He came at me—and
I fought him—I was mounted as he
was.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tired old voice trailed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” I prompted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started. “What was I saying? Oh
yes, about Og. You asked me about Og,
didn’t you? We might have been knights
of the Court of King Arthur—jousting with
our lances. I can remember it now—clearly.
I would have run him through almost at
the first tilt, but that girl threw herself between
us. I did not like to kill her. That
was bad. Accident—I could not help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean Maaret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maaret? Yes, that was her name, wasn’t
it? I remember now. She died in Nona’s
arms—after I had killed Og. The girl did
not know I had killed him. She died—still
loving Og, and glad that she had given her
life for him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I remember that now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Nona and your boy? What of them?
And you, Nemo—who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I don’t know. I remember that at
the last, I was with Nona and boy. The
war was over. I was sick. Yes, that was
it—very, very sick. They had me in bed.
Nona was bending over me. I can see her
now—so beautiful. It was getting dark,
but Nona said——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nona said——” I prompted gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I recall it now. Nona said I must
fight the darkness that was creeping upon
me. But I couldn’t. It came—darkness and
silence. Slowly. But everything was growing
black. And Nona’s voice imploring me
not to go, grew dimmer—far away—dimmer
and darker—everything dark, and then—I
was gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead?” I said softly. What did he
mean? What could it all mean, except what
the rational officials of the Institution said?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook himself slightly. “Did I say
dead? I don’t know whether I mean that
or not. I don’t know what I mean. Blackness—nothingness—and
then I found myself
on one of your horrible crowded streets
here on Earth. An old man—cheated out
of all those years of life—grown old and
feeble, when last I had been young and
strong. And my Nona and boy gone——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was trembling now; and suddenly he
turned on me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away, please. It—it hurts me to
think these thoughts. My Nona gone——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any of you care to advance your
theories, I shall be glad to hear from you.</p>
